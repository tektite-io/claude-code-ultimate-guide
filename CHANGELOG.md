# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Auto Dream section** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` ~l.4945): Community-discovered memory consolidation feature for Claude Code. Documents the 4-phase process (Orient, Gather Signal, Consolidate, Prune & Index), trigger conditions (24h + 5 sessions), access via `/memory`, and caveats about unofficial status. Sourced from Piebald-AI/claude-code-system-prompts. Added pointer in `machine-readable/reference.yaml`.

### Documentation

- **Claude Code Releases**: Updated tracking to v2.1.83
  - `managed-settings.d/` drop-in directory for independent policy fragments
  - `CwdChanged` and `FileChanged` hook events for reactive environment management
  - Transcript search in Ctrl+O mode; `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBPROCESS_ENV_SCRUB=1` credential scrubbing
  - Security: Fixed `--mcp-config` bypassing `allowedMcpServers`/`deniedMcpServers` managed policy
  - Fixed macOS exit hang; `sandbox.failIfUnavailable` setting

### Added
- **Glossary** (`guide/core/glossary.md`): new alphabetical reference with 120+ Claude Code-specific terms, community-coined patterns, and AI engineering concepts. Single table with 4 columns (Term, Definition, Category, Subcategory). Covers Claude Code modes, hooks, permissions, models, workflow patterns, security concepts, and ecosystem tools. Linked from `guide/README.md` Core Reference section and `machine-readable/reference.yaml`.
- **"Slop" attribution** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`): added one-sentence attribution to Simon Willison's 2024 coinage before the Desloppify section, with link to source article.

### Fixed
- **`paths:` array bug in rules frontmatter** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`): Both path-scoped rules examples (lines ~5147 and ~5856) used the documented `paths:` YAML array syntax, which fails silently. Replaced with `globs:` field and unquoted CSV patterns in both code examples. Added blockquote warnings at both locations explaining the root cause (internal CSV parser bug, confirmed GH#17204 and 8 duplicate issues) and the working workaround.

## [3.37.5] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **Resource Evaluation + Integration — Veille CC Releases 2.1.77-2.1.81** (score 3/5): Weekly release summary covering 5 releases (March 17-20, 2026). Releases already tracked in claude-code-releases.yaml/md. Audit revealed 5 gaps in thematic sections: `StopFailure` hook added to Event Types table (`ultimate-guide.md`), `rate_limits` statusline field documented with JSON schema (`ultimate-guide.md`), `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` persistent storage documented in Plugin System section (`ultimate-guide.md`), `--bare` mode added to GitHub Actions CI example (`ultimate-guide.md`), `sandbox.filesystem` settings block (allowWrite/denyRead/allowRead) added to `guide/security/sandbox-native.md`.

### Security
- **Threat database updated to v2.9.0** (`examples/commands/resources/threat-db.yaml`): 1 new malicious author (`sakaen736jih`, 199 automated skills, Bitdefender/Particula), 5 new CVEs (CVE-2026-4192 quip-mcp-server RCE, CVE-2026-4198 mcp-server-auto-commit injection, CVE-2026-33252 MCP Go SDK CSRF, CVE-2026-4270 AWS API MCP path traversal, CVE-2026-27826 MCP Atlassian SSRF), 2 new campaigns (ClickFix OpenClaw, Fake CLI Prerequisites via openclawcli.vercel.app), 2 new IOCs (malicious domains), 1 new scanning tool (AquilaX), 1 new defensive resource (42crunch), 9 new sources. ClawHavoc stats updated (341 → 1,184+ malicious skills by March 1, 2026).

### Fixed
- **`eval-skills` skill — removed non-official `tags` frontmatter criterion**: `tags` is not a supported field in the Claude Code skill spec. The skill was incorrectly scoring it as a quality criterion (1pt) and listing it in the parse step. Removed `tags` from frontmatter, scoring table, and parse instructions. Scoring total adjusted from 15 to 14 pts with updated thresholds (≥80% = ≥11/14, 60-79% = 8-10/14). Added an explicit note warning against using `tags`. Reported by community via Alexandre Aubert.

## [3.37.4] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **Resource Evaluation + Integration — Harman "Just-in-Time Catching Test Generation at Meta"** (arxiv 2601.22832, score 4/5): JiTTests are ephemeral, LLM-generated tests triggered at PR submission that fail by design to surface regressions. Production-verified at Meta (4x over hardening tests, 70% reduction in human review load). Integrated into `guide/core/methodologies.md` (new JiTTesting subsection) and `guide/workflows/tdd-with-claude.md` (forward link from Mutation Testing).
- **Resource Evaluation + Integration — Caliber config quality tool** (score 3/5): CLI tool scoring AI agent config quality 0-100 (61 deterministic checks, local-only). Integrated into `guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md` as new "Configuration Quality" section.
- **Resource Evaluation — Larridin "Building AI-Native Engineering Teams"** (Kanitkar, score 4/5): Producer role concept, "job is now the spec" reframing, and two anti-patterns (no parallel implementation subagents; provide full plan text to agents). Integration target: `guide/roles/`.
- **Resource Evaluation — Anthropic weekly watch March 16-23, 2026** (score 3/5): Three gaps identified for integration — `thinking.display: "omitted"` (extended thinking section), model capabilities API fields, `--bare` vs `-p` CI/CD tradeoffs.

### Changed
- **Claude Code releases tracking** updated to v2.1.81 — `--bare` flag for scripted `-p` calls, `--channels` permission relay, worktree auto-resume fix, MCP tool call collapsing.
- **README** — dynamic star history chart added.
- **`guide/ecosystem/mcp-vs-cli.md`** — historical arc intro paragraph (browser → IDE+MCP → CLI agents, 2022-26).

- **Resource Evaluation — Anthropic weekly watch March 16-23, 2026** (`docs/resource-evaluations/2026-03-23-veille-hebdo-anthropic-16-23-mars.md`): Score 3/5. Perplexity synthesis covering CC 2.1.81, Python SDK v0.85/v0.86, and two Platform API entries. CC releases already tracked. Three actionable gaps identified: (1) `thinking.display: "omitted"` absent from extended thinking section — multi-turn API pattern for chain continuity without full thinking text transmission; (2) model capabilities API fields (`GET /v1/models` now returns `capabilities` object + `max_input_tokens`) absent from guide — enables runtime-dynamic model selection; (3) `--bare` vs standard `-p` tradeoffs missing from CI/CD scripting section. 81k study and Python SDK items out of scope.

- **Resource Evaluation + Integration — Caliber (rely-ai-org/caliber)** (`docs/resource-evaluations/caliber-config-quality-tool.md`): Score 3/5. CLI tool that scores AI agent config quality (0-100, deterministic, 61 checks, local-only), generates tailored configs via codebase fingerprinting, and detects drift between code and CLAUDE.md using git-based signals. Early-stage (released March 2026, 65 stars at eval). Full source code audit conducted. Integrated into `guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md` as a new "Configuration Quality" section between Configuration Management and Engineering Standards Distribution — a gap not covered by any existing tool in the guide.

- **Guide update: Configuration Quality section in `third-party-tools.md`** (`guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md`): New section added for Caliber. Includes full scoring rubric table (6 categories), delta comparison vs AIBlueprint/Packmind, code examples, security note (write access to CLAUDE.md), and cross-refs. ToC updated, Recommendations by Persona updated.

- **Claude Code Releases**: Updated tracking to v2.1.81 — `--bare` flag for scripted `-p` calls (skips hooks/LSP/plugins, API key only), `--channels` permission relay (forward tool approvals to phone), worktree session auto-resume fix, MCP read/search collapsing into "Queried {server}" line, plan mode hides "clear context" by default, fixed concurrent sessions re-authenticating on OAuth refresh, fixed Node.js 18 crash

- **Resource Evaluation + Integration — Harman "Just-in-Time Catching Test Generation at Meta" (arxiv 2601.22832)** (`docs/resource-evaluations/2026-03-22-harman-jittesting-meta-arxiv.md`): Score 4/5. Industrial paper by Mark Harman (Meta), Jan 30 2026. JiTTests are ephemeral, LLM-generated tests triggered at PR submission — they fail by design to surface regressions, then are discarded. Production-verified: 4x improvement over hardening tests, 70% reduction in human review load, 4 serious failures caught out of 41 candidates at Meta's 100M+ LoC codebase. Integrated into `guide/core/methodologies.md` (new JiTTesting subsection after CDD, with practical approximation pattern for Claude Code today) and `guide/workflows/tdd-with-claude.md` (forward link from Mutation Testing advanced pattern).

- **Resource Evaluation — Larridin "Building AI-Native Engineering Teams" (Kanitkar)** (`docs/resource-evaluations/larridin-ai-native-teams-kanitkar.md`): Score 4/5. Practitioner playbook from Ameya Kanitkar (Co-founder & CTO, Larridin), Jan 2026. Key contributions not yet covered in the guide: "job is now the spec" mindset reframing, Producer role concept for AI-native team coordination, team structure advice (small in-office teams, flow management for teammates), and anti-patterns section with two specific operational constraints (never dispatch parallel implementation subagents; never let agent read plan files — provide full text instead). Context engineering, Ralph Wiggum, and Docker sandboxes already documented. Model version specifics (GPT 5.2) flagged as unverifiable. Integration target: `guide/roles/` and adoption section of ultimate guide.

- **README: Star History chart added** (`README.md`): Dynamic star growth chart from star-history.com embedded before the Contributing section. Shows the repo trajectory since January 2026 (0 → 2K+ stars). Renders live on GitHub via the star-history.com SVG API.

- **Resource Evaluation — Arnaud Gaches "MCP vs CLI" (Dev with IA)** (`docs/resource-evaluations/arnaud-gaches-mcp-vs-cli-devwithia.md`): Score 2/5. Community synthesis from the Dev with IA Slack/LinkedIn (1500+ devs). Key contributions: three-phase historical arc (browser 2022-23 → IDE+MCP 2024-25 → CLI agents 2025-26), update on MCP token cost (author claims unused servers now inject 0 tokens), model-size heuristic (frontier models → CLI, small local models → MCP), enterprise case for MCP Remote (centralized updates, observability). Scored 2/5 for lack of verifiable sources and unclear attribution. Applied: historical arc intro added to `guide/ecosystem/mcp-vs-cli.md`.

- **Guide update: historical arc intro in `mcp-vs-cli.md`** (`guide/ecosystem/mcp-vs-cli.md`): Two-sentence context paragraph added at the top explaining the interface evolution (browser → IDE+MCP → CLI agents, 2022-26) that frames why the MCP vs CLI question exists. Sourced from Arnaud Gaches community synthesis evaluation.

## [3.37.3] - 2026-03-20

- **New skill: `eval-skills`** (`examples/skills/eval-skills/SKILL.md`): Skills-only audit tool with integrated effort-level inference engine. Discovers all SKILL.md files + flat skill files in `.claude/skills/`, scores each across 6 criteria (15 pts: name, description quality, allowed-tools scope, effort field, content structure, tags), infers appropriate `effort` level from content signals (mechanical → `low`, bounded analysis → `medium`, adversarial/architectural → `high`), flags mismatches between declared and inferred effort, and outputs a copy-paste ready patch block for missing/wrong effort fields. Portable across projects — drop in `.claude/skills/` and run `/eval-skills`. Guide updated with comparison vs `/audit-agents-skills` in the Validating Skills section.

- **New skill: `smart-explore`** (`examples/skills/smart-explore.md`): Progressive code exploration using tree-sitter AST — structure first, drill second. Three approaches: (A) no-setup discipline with grep-based signature extraction, (B) tree-sitter CLI + lightweight Python script (50-150 tokens per file vs 2,000-5,000 for full reads), (C) MCP server options (mcp-server-tree-sitter for general use, code-review-graph for PR reviews, jCodeMunch for symbol lookup). Inspired by Alex Newman (Claude-MEM) + validated by Aider repo map pattern at 40k+ stars. Honest benchmarks: ~86% token reduction for module exploration, ~90% for feature-finding tasks.

- **Resource Evaluation — Tree-Sitter Progressive Code Exploration** (`docs/resource-evaluations/tree-sitter-progressive-code-exploration.md`): Score 4/5. Ecosystem evaluation of 5 tools implementing the AST-based progressive exploration pattern: jCodeMunch-MCP (~1,200 stars, 10-25% realistic savings, commercial $79+), mcp-server-tree-sitter/wrale (~270 stars, raw AST queries, Feb 2026), code-review-graph (~2,000 stars, 6.8x average for PR reviews, MIT), CodeRLM (192 stars, Claude autonomy problem), Aider repo map (reference implementation, 40k+ stars). Pattern fills genuine gap in guide (command savings via RTK are documented; code reading savings were not). Primary recommendation: code-review-graph for teams doing PR reviews (MIT, marketplace), mcp-server-tree-sitter for raw AST access, Approach B (script, no MCP) for solo workflows.

- **New guide section: Progressive Code Exploration (Smart Explore)** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`): 110-line section added near the RTK token efficiency section. Explains the structure-first → target → cross-reference pattern with worked examples, CLAUDE.md snippet, and comparison table (RTK vs smart-explore vs grepai). Honest benchmarks: 86-92% token reduction for module exploration. Three approaches: no-setup grep discipline, tree-sitter CLI + Python script (50-150 tokens per file vs 2,000-5,000 for full reads), MCP server options. Skill file reference: `examples/skills/smart-explore.md`.

- **Resource Evaluation — Yagr (Y)our (A)gent (G)rounded in (R)eality** (`docs/resource-evaluations/2026-03-20-yagr-etienne-lescot.md`): Score 2/5. Watch list. Autonomous automation agent (n8n-as-code execution layer) that generates durable n8n workflows from natural language. Core differentiator is auditability: the workflow persists as an inspectable artifact instead of a disposable script. Scored down due to single-source evidence (author's own LinkedIn + README), star count misattribution (500+ stars belong to n8n-as-code, not Yagr itself), and unverified deploy claim. Re-evaluate in ~3 months if community traction materializes.

- **Claude Code releases tracking updated to v2.1.80** (`machine-readable/claude-code-releases.yaml`, `guide/core/claude-code-releases.md`): `rate_limits` field in statusline for Claude.ai rate limit usage (5h + 7d windows), `source: 'settings'` plugin marketplace (inline declarations in settings.json), `effort` frontmatter for skills/slash commands, `--channels` research preview (MCP servers push messages), fixed `--resume` dropping parallel tool results, ~80MB memory reduction on startup for large repos.

- **Fix: `.fastembed_cache/` added to `.gitignore`**: Prevents the FastEmbed model cache directory from being committed accidentally (generated by grepai/fastembed tooling).

- **Fix: `smart-suggest.sh` typo** (`examples/hooks/bash/smart-suggest.sh`): Corrected "mandato ry" → "mandatory" in the Tier 0 comment block.

## [3.37.2] - 2026-03-19

- **RSS Feed added to cc.bruniaux.com** (`landing: src/pages/rss.xml.ts`, `src/data/rss-entries.ts`): Unified RSS feed at `/rss.xml` merging Claude Code CLI releases and guide content updates (guide releases, new pages, new cards, new whitepapers). Auto-discovery `<link>` tag in all page heads, RSS icon in footer and "More" nav dropdown, mention in announcement banner. Dedicated `rss-entries.ts` data file for manual guide entries. Workflow integrated in `/release` (step 6.5 auto-drafts entry) and `/update-infos-release` (step 4.5 for notable CC releases). Post-push hook in landing repo reminds to update `rss-entries.ts`. README updated with RSS link.

- **Footer links fixed and expanded** (`landing: src/components/global/Footer.astro`): Architecture and Data Privacy now link to in-site guide reader (`/guide/core/architecture/`, `/guide/security/data-privacy/`) instead of GitHub raw files. Added missing pages: Recap Cards, AI Roles, Context, Ecosystem, FAQ.

- **Sitemap updated** (`landing: src/pages/sitemap/index.astro`): RSS Feed entry added in Reference section.

- **Fix — `/release` command updated with RSS step** (`.claude/commands/release.md`): Step 6.5 added — auto-drafts an `rss-entries.ts` entry from CHANGELOG after every release (patch included). Ensures feed stays current without manual effort.

- **Fix — Hook format updated to new matcher+hooks[] structure** (`examples/config/settings.json`, `examples/claude-md/learning-mode.md`, `~/.claude/settings.json`): Claude Code now requires hooks to use `{"matcher": "...", "hooks": [{...}]}` instead of the old flat `{"matcher": "...", "command": "..."}` format. Updated all example files and global settings accordingly.

- **New guide sections: Cross-Model Review, Lightweight Role-Switch, Task Sizing** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`): Three gaps filled from resource evaluation gap analysis. (1) Cross-model review pattern after SE-CoVe section: generate with one model, review with another, with cost-effective patterns table and custom agent template. (2) Lightweight role-switch review as simpler alternative to SE-CoVe for everyday development. (3) Consolidated task sizing guidance in "Mixing Unrelated Tasks" section with splitting heuristic table and cross-reference to spec-first workflow.

- **Resource Evaluation -- Ischenko "You're probably using Claude Code wrong"** (`docs/resource-evaluations/ischenko-claude-code-workflow-quality.md`): Score 2/5 (marginal, do not integrate). LinkedIn article proposing 7 workflow patterns (reality checks, author/reviewer separation, project-aware reviews, requirements artifacts, TDD, small tasks, human elevation) with copy-paste prompt templates. 75-85% overlap with existing guide content (SE-CoVe, spec-first.md, tdd-with-claude.md, exploration-workflow.md). Headline "30% quality improvement" claim has no methodology. Only non-redundant element: the 7 prompt templates, which are formatting convenience rather than new insight. Two independent gaps surfaced for future work: multi-model review pattern (near zero coverage in guide) and consolidated task sizing section.

- **Claude Code releases tracking updated to v2.1.79** (`machine-readable/claude-code-releases.yaml`, `guide/core/claude-code-releases.md`): `--console` flag for `claude auth login` (API billing auth), Show turn duration toggle in `/config`, VSCode `/remote-control` command + AI-generated session tab titles, fixed `claude -p` hanging without explicit stdin, enterprise 429 retry fix, SessionEnd hooks on `/resume` session switch, ~18MB startup memory improvement.

- **Resource Evaluation — Multi-Session Management Landscape** (`docs/resource-evaluations/082-multi-session-management-landscape.md`): Score 4/5. Landscape overview of 13 tools across 4 categories for managing multiple Claude Code sessions across multiple projects. Monitoring dashboards: ccm (212 stars, TUI + mobile WebUI), sniffly (1 170 stars, analytics), claude-code-dashboard (token/cost per session). Remote access: vibetunnel (4 276 stars), cc-hub (color themes + file diffs). Orchestrators: claudio (22 stars, isolated worktrees + 14 color themes + planning modes), multi-agent-shogun (1 082 stars, tmux fan-out hierarchy). Sound/notifications: no packaged per-project audio solution — DIY via `settings.local.json` + `afplay` hook per project. Recommends integrating a "Multi-Session Management" section in the guide's third-party tools coverage.

- **Resource Evaluation — obra/Superpowers** (`docs/resource-evaluations/obra-superpowers-evaluation.md`): Score 5/5. Full software development methodology suite (95k+ stars, 7.5k forks, verified via GitHub API). 7 context-aware skills: brainstorm-first spec gate, implementation planning, subagent-driven development with two-stage review, mandatory TDD enforcement, code review, git worktrees, branch lifecycle. Available on official Claude Code plugin marketplace. Integrated in 4 locations: Plugin Ecosystem section in `third-party-tools.md` (alongside gstack), obra row upgrade in `ultimate-guide.md` skills.sh table, cross-reference in `tdd-with-claude.md`, cross-reference in `spec-first.md`.

- **Resource Evaluation — ManoMano "Project Aegis"** (`docs/resource-evaluations/2026-03-19-manomano-project-aegis-serena.md`): Score 3/5. ManoMano engineering team benchmarked AI coding agents internally and identified Serena MCP as a must-have for large codebase navigation. Serena (oraios/serena) uses LSP for deterministic symbol-level navigation (find_symbol, get_symbols_overview, session memory) — distinct from GrepAI's embedding approach. Guide already covers Serena extensively (8+ files, `ultimate-guide.md:10527`, `search-tools-mastery.md`). Specific gap confirmed: no Serena entry in `mcp-servers-ecosystem.md` (only GrepAI listed under Code Search), creating a discoverability inconsistency. Recommended action: add formal Serena entry to ecosystem file with cross-link to search-tools-mastery.md.

## [3.37.1] - 2026-03-18

- **Threat database updated to v2.8.0** (`examples/commands/resources/threat-db.yaml`): 7 new entries covering March 2026 threats. **New campaigns**: GhostClaw (malicious npm `@openclaw-ai/openclawai`, GhostLoader RAT with SOCKS5 proxy + clipboard monitor, 178 downloads) and Fake OpenClaw Installer (Stealth Packer + GhostSocks via malicious GitHub repos indexed by Bing AI). **New malicious packages**: `@openclaw-ai/openclawai` and `ambar-src` (~50K downloads, evasion techniques). **New CVE**: CVE-2026-24910 (Bun runtime v<1.3.5, lifecycle scripts bypass origin validation). **New attack techniques**: T017 Shadow MCP (employees deploying unvetted MCP servers without IT oversight) and T018 AI Search Result Poisoning (AI-generated search results recommending malicious repos). **New scanning tools**: Jozu Agent Guard (zero-trust AI runtime, non-bypassable policies, 2026-03-17) and MCP Sentinel (RSAC 2026, request/arg scanning for sensitive data). `minimum_safe_versions` updated with `bun: 1.3.5`.

- **Claude Code releases tracking updated to v2.1.78** (`machine-readable/claude-code-releases.yaml`, `guide/core/claude-code-releases.md`): StopFailure hook event, ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA} persistent plugin state, effort/maxTurns/disallowedTools frontmatter for plugin agents, streaming line-by-line, 3 security fixes (silent sandbox disable, MCP deny rules bypass, protected dirs writable in bypassPermissions mode).

- **Skill descriptions improved — 19 skills updated** (`examples/skills/`): cleaner, action-oriented descriptions with explicit "Use when" triggers. Selective merge from @popey (Tessl) PR #9: kept improved `description:` lines while preserving full reference documentation in template skills.

- **Fix — MCP vs CLI token overhead claim updated** (`guide/ecosystem/mcp-vs-cli.md`): corrected outdated token cost figures following v2.1.7 MCP Tool Search (lazy loading). "Token cost of MCP schemas" section rewritten with lazy loading mechanics and measured 85% reduction benchmark (55K → 8.7K for 5-server setup). Credit: Antoine Salesse.

- **Resource Evaluation #081 — Rippletide Code** (`docs/resource-evaluations/081-rippletide-code-rule-enforcement.md`): hook-native runtime rule enforcement for Claude Code (score 3/5, integrate with caveats). Addresses the CLAUDE.md degradation problem: rules ignored after 40+ entries, lost after context compaction.

- **New self-assessment section — Agent Adoption Curve** (`guide/roles/learning-with-ai.md`): 7-level maturity scale (0-6) for developers to self-locate on the Claude Code sophistication spectrum, adapted from Nicolas Martignole (Back Market) maturity framework.

- **New guide section §5.5 — Registry-based Discovery: ctx7 CLI** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`): Context7's CLI companion (`npx ctx7`) for automated skill discovery and MCP setup. Resource evaluation: `docs/resource-evaluations/2026-03-17-context7-cli.md` (score 4/5).

- **Resource Evaluations #079 + #080** (`docs/resource-evaluations/`): Fabro workflow orchestration (3/5, Watch) and Goose by Block update (4/5) with stats refresh (15.4k → 33k stars), Recipes section, and subagent orchestration documentation.

- **Doc audit — stats sync**: corrected stale counts. Templates unified to 217. Guide lines: "22K" → "23K+". Quiz: 311 → 271.

## [3.37.0] - 2026-03-17

- **ICM v0.5.0 — setup guide + session starter template**: corrected `icm init` documentation (3 explicit modes: `--mode mcp`, `--mode hook`, `--mode skill` — not a single interactive command); fixed CLI syntax (`--importance` is an enum `critical|high|medium|low`, not a float; no `memory` subcommand); added `examples/memory/icm-session-starter.md` ready-to-use onboarding prompt to paste at the start of any session.

- **New guide section — MCP vs CLI Decision Guide** (`guide/ecosystem/mcp-vs-cli.md`): full comparison of MCP servers vs CLI tools across 4 decision dimensions (user type, model capability, observability needs, schema stability), decision matrix by situation, token cost analysis, tooling overview (RTK, MCPorter, mcp2cli), and practitioner quotes. Cross-linked from `mcp-servers-ecosystem.md`. Landing page published at `cc.bruniaux.com/ecosystem/mcp-vs-cli/` with 4 decision cards, 15-row collapsible guidance table, practitioner quotes section, and tooling micro-section. `check-landing-sync.sh` extended with section 7 for MCP vs CLI sync tracking.

- **Resource evaluations (3)**: mcp2cli (3/5, MCP/OpenAPI/GraphQL to runtime CLI, 96-99% token savings claim, 8-day-old tool with structural mismatch against Claude Code native MCP architecture — watch list + document schema overhead insight); MCPorter by Steinberger (3/5, TypeScript MCP toolkit with auto-discovery, CLI generation and TS codegen — useful companion for testing MCP servers and hook scripts); CircleCI MCP vs CLI blog (3/5, inner loop / outer loop decision framework, 6-question guide, directional browser automation benchmark — worth borrowing the vocabulary, not the benchmark numbers).

- **WP10 v1.2.0 — Marc Sélince feedback (DAF/finance)**: 6 corrections FR+EN on `10-budget-ia.qmd` / `10-ai-budget.qmd`. New `## Pour le DAF/CFO` section (ROI + OpEx/CapEx framing, replaces placeholder callout). New `## Freins COMEX au-delà du coût` Q&A section (vendor dependency, IP risk, lock-in pricing). §3.1 reframed "Attraction et rétention des top performers" (market tight for seniors/experts, not all profiles). §3.2 CTO: new "ROI des heures d'ingénieur" sub-point (LLMs on mechanical code free engineering time for architecture). §4.1 Budget: option 4 added (replace paid tool with OS equivalent for net-zero pilot), "200-500$/mois" figure removed from discretionary budget.

- **Recap cards — EN translations created + FR fixes**: 57 EN recap cards created from scratch (`whitepapers/recap-cards/en/`) by translating all FR cards. FR cards batch-updated: `guide-version` and `version` fields bumped `3.32.1` → `3.36.0` across all 57 FR cards. Factual fixes: T19 (context window) corrected "1M beta, API only" → "1M GA for Max/Team/Enterprise CC plans (v2.1.75, no header needed)"; T01 (essential commands) updated with `/plan`, `/effort`, `/branch`, `/rename`, `/loop`, `/voice`, `/fast`, removed non-existent `/cost`, corrected keyboard shortcuts. `docs/for-cto.md` updated: "whitepapers coming soon" → links to `florian.bruniaux.com/guides` in all 4 occurrences.

- **Fix dead link** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` §3.5): Packmind anchor `../ecosystem/third-party-tools.md#packmind` corrected to `ecosystem/third-party-tools.md#packmind` (wrong `../` prefix was resolving outside `guide/`).

- **Whitepapers v2.2 — Guide content sync (7 WPs updated)**: synced WP content with guide v3.27.6 → v3.36.0 delta.
  - **WP00** (v1.2.0): 1M context corrected "beta" → GA (v2.1.75); 7 major features table added (Tasks API, Auto-memories, Agent Teams, LSP Tool, Remote Control, MCP Elicitation)
  - **WP03** (v1.1.0): PreToolUse security fix callout (v2.1.77 — `"allow"` bypassed enterprise `deny`); `allowRead` sandbox parameter added
  - **WP05** (v1.2.0): Native Code Review section (Research Preview, Teams/Enterprise) — multi-agent, 3 trigger modes, `REVIEW.md`, ~$15-25/PR pricing
  - **WP07** (v1.1.0): 12 new slash commands, 7 new hook events, extended CLI flags, Remote Control section, 1M GA correction
  - **WP08** (v1.2.0): Identity drift after compaction pattern added (UserPromptSubmit hook + agent-identity.txt re-injection)
  - **WP09** (v1.1.0): Review bottleneck inversion section; Regulatory Exposure section (EU AI Act GPAI/high-risk, FDA AI/ML Guidance)
  - WP02: no hook events section in scope; WP01/WP04/WP06/WP10: no gaps identified

- **Cheatsheet + reference.yaml maintenance**: date updated February → March 2026 in `guide/cheatsheet.md`; "Command not found" fix updated to use native installer (`curl | sh`); `machine-readable/reference.yaml` `updated` field bumped to 2026-03-17.

- **Whitepapers v2 — Reviewer corrections** (6 relecteurs: Edouard, Mat, Nicolas, Marc, Anthony, Emmanuel): 8-phase correction plan applied across 10 whitepapers (WP00–WP10) FR+EN.
  - **Phase 1 — Factual errors**: npm "deprecated" → "not recommended" (WP00), native installer added as primary install method (WP00 EN), context window 200K vs 1M clarified (WP00 FR+EN), Claude Max ratio corrected to range 1.5-3% FR / 1-1.6% EN (WP10), sub-agents vs agent teams difference correctly stated as P2P messaging + coordination tools, not context isolation (WP08 EN)
  - **Phase 2 — Accents + articles + typos**: ~200+ accent corrections across WP08 FR (977 lines); anglicisms corrected in WP02 FR (on-demand, per-project, Memories, Feature opt-in); table row reformulated in WP00 FR; accents restored in WP02 FR (~10 passages)
  - **Phase 3 — Malformed sentences**: "chez dans une fintech" fixed, meta-sentence "This is the single definition..." removed (WP08 FR+EN); "Multiple Claude instances..." rewritten as complete sentence (WP05 FR+EN); Turnkey Quickstart explained (WP05 FR+EN)
  - **Phase 4 — Anglicisms + clarifications**: tmux noted as external tool, not built-in (WP08 FR+EN); "OUI →" residue fixed in WP05 EN; user-level/project-level translated (WP05 FR)
  - **Phase 6 — WP08 structural corrections**: "~30K lines" clarified as "~30K lines ≈ 1M tokens"; continuous merge definition improved; note added that solo Claude Code agent is a full autonomous agent, not a chatbot
  - **Phase 7 — WP10 restructuration**: executive summary added (5 key metrics); learning curve duplication removed; BCG 2025 source improved; pricing note "March 2026" added; "5-10 people in 2020" reformulated without unsourced claim; "Beyond engineering teams" section expanded with 3 concrete use cases; CFO/DAF and change management placeholder callouts added

- **Resource Evaluation #078 + integration** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`): HumanLayer — "Skill Issue: Harness Engineering for Coding Agents" (March 12, 2026). Score 3/5. "Harness Engineer" concept already covered in `guide/roles/ai-roles.md §10` (Martin Fowler source); ETH Zürich study already integrated. Two genuine gaps filled: (1) **Silent Success hook pattern** — asymmetric hook behavior (exit 0 = silence, exit 2 = re-engage agent) named and documented with example before §7.3; (2) **CLI vs MCP training-data argument** — familiar CLIs (git/grep/jq) are already in model weights, CLAUDE.md usage examples often beat a verbose MCP server for standard tools; added after MCP Tool Search section.

## [3.36.0] - 2026-03-17

### Documentation

- **Resource Evaluation #076**: Addy Osmani — "Stop Using /init for AGENTS.md" (Feb 23, 2026). Score 3/5. Secondary synthesis of ETH Zürich paper (already evaluated). Verified: ETH Zürich claims confirmed. Unverified: Lulla et al. (ICSE JAWs 2026) and ACE framework (ICLR 2026) — no findable academic source. Arize AI concept verified, specific numbers uncorroborated. Integration: added discoverability filter + anchoring risk concepts to §3.1, added research note (ETH Zürich), added `/init` warning in commands table.

- **Resource Evaluation #077 + integration** (`guide/roles/learning-with-ai.md`): "Comprehension Debt" article (LinkedIn, March 14, 2026). Score 3/5. Integrated: (1) "comprehension debt" as emerging term after Vibe Coding section, (2) review bottleneck inversion framing — juniors can now generate code faster than seniors can audit, (3) new "Regulatory Exposure" subsection for tech leads covering EU AI Act active dates (GPAI Aug 2025, high-risk Aug 2026) and FDA AI guidance (Jan + Jun 2025). Confirmed by Perplexity research.

- **Claude Code Releases**: Updated tracking to v2.1.77
  - Opus 4.6 default max output raised to 64k tokens; upper bound for Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6 raised to 128k tokens
  - Security fix: `PreToolUse` hooks returning `"allow"` could bypass enterprise `deny` permission rules
  - `allowRead` sandbox setting; `/branch` replaces `/fork`; `/copy N` for Nth-latest response
  - Breaking: `Agent` tool `resume` parameter removed — use `SendMessage({to: agentId})` instead
  - Fixed auto-updater GBs memory leak; fixed `--resume` truncating recent history

- **Claude Code Releases**: Updated tracking to v2.1.76
  - MCP elicitation support — servers request structured input mid-task via interactive dialog
  - New hooks: `Elicitation`, `ElicitationResult`, `PostCompact`
  - `-n`/`--name` CLI flag for session display name; `worktree.sparsePaths` for monorepo sparse checkout
  - `/effort` slash command; fixed ToolSearch deferred tools losing schemas after compaction
  - Auto-compact circuit breaker (stops after 3 failures); fixed `Bash(cmd:*)` rules with `#` in args

- **Resource evaluation** (rejected, no file): LinkedIn post "Five Levels of Context Engineering" by Matthew Alverson (via Addy Osmani) — score 1/5, rejected. Content is a pedagogical reformulation of concepts already covered with more rigor in `guide/core/context-engineering.md`. Alverson's 5-level taxonomy is not empirically grounded and not widely cited in the literature. Evaluation surfaced 3 real gaps now addressed (see Added section). Better primary sources identified: Anthropic Engineering Blog (Sept 2025), MCP Maturity Model (Mitra, Nov 2025).

- **Resource evaluation** (no file — text digest): Anthropic weekly recap March 9-15, 2026 (5 Claude Code releases, Code Review launch, 1M GA, Spring Break promo, corporate news) — score 4/5. Two gaps actioned: (1) Code Review product feature added as `guide/workflows/code-review.md`; (2) 1M context status updated from beta to GA in `guide/ultimate-guide.md` lines 2021-2070. Source reliability note: digest incorrectly attributes Claude Code changelog to `anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python` (correct repo: `anthropics/claude-code`); Code Review pricing ($15-25/PR) verified against official docs.

- **Resource evaluation** (`docs/resource-evaluations/eval-claude-1m-context-window-jp-caparas.md`): JP Caparas article on 1M token context window — score 2/5, do not integrate. Central claim (flat pricing, no surcharge above 200K tokens) is factually wrong; invalidates the competitive pricing analysis. Fact-check table, comparative analysis vs guide, and independent action items (verify 1M GA status, potential update to guide lines 2028-2070 on beta/GA status).

### Changed

- **External support section — clarified positioning** (`docs/for-cto.md`, `docs/for-tech-leads.md`, `docs/for-cio-ceo.md`): Brown Bag Lunch, talks, and speaker/panelist slots (1-3h) explicitly marked as free and done for networking/challenge purposes. Training/consulting missions framed as open-but-not-actively-sought with "contact for availability and potentially pricing" wording. Contact link updated to `florian.bruniaux.com` across all three files.

### Fixed

- **`/release` skill — 3 correctness gaps** (`.claude/commands/release.md` Step 4): (1) Quiz count command fixed: `grep -c '  - id:'` was returning per-file counts and taking only the last file's value — replaced with `grep -r '  - id:' quiz/questions/ | wc -l` to sum across the entire directory. (2) `llms-full.txt` now documents all 4 occurrences requiring update (Metadata block, "For Learning" URL text, "Template Library" section heading, repo tree comment) — previously only Metadata fields were listed, causing silent drift. (3) Verification gate added after Step 4: bash block prints all three llms files' key fields side-by-side against expected values before the commit, making any mismatch visible immediately.

### Added

- **Resource evaluation #078: claude-swarm-monitor** (`docs/resource-evaluations/078-claude-swarm-monitor.md`): TUI dashboard (Rust + Ratatui) for monitoring multi-agent Claude Code workflows across git worktrees. Score 3/5 — watch-list. Unique angles: JSONL-native session file monitoring (distinct from agent-chat's SSE approach) and Docker stack visibility per worktree. Not integrated into guide yet — 10 stars, Linux-only, sub-agent tracking claim unverified. Re-evaluate at 50+ stars or confirmed macOS production use.

- **Packmind — Engineering Standards Distribution** (`guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md`, `guide/ultimate-guide.md`, `guide/ecosystem/mcp-servers-ecosystem.md`): Added Packmind (score 4/5, eval #076) as a new "Engineering Standards Distribution" section in third-party-tools. Tool distributes CLAUDE.md + slash commands + skills across repos and agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf) from a single playbook, ships an MCP server, Apache-2.0 CLI self-hostable. Added cross-reference paragraph at end of ultimate-guide.md §3.5 (Team Configuration at Scale) linking the per-project `.claude/rules/` pattern to org-scale tooling. Added Packmind MCP server entry in mcp-servers-ecosystem.md Orchestration section.

- **3 new AI roles** (`guide/roles/ai-roles.md`): Added MLOps Engineer (§14), AI Developer Advocate (§15), and AI Orchestration Engineer (§16) as full role profiles. Includes responsibilities, required skills, salary benchmarks, entry paths, and key distinctions from adjacent roles. Sections 14→17 renumbered accordingly. Removed "Orchestration engineer" from "What's Not a Role Yet" — job postings at Vista Equity, Zapier, Heidi Health, and Adobe confirm it's now a real title. Career Decision Matrix and Salary Benchmarks updated with all 3 roles. Based on Perplexity market research (March 2026).

- **Failure-triggered context drift pattern** (`guide/core/architecture.md` §Session Degradation Limits): New subsection documenting a distinct degradation mode from compaction drift — repeated tool failures accumulate error noise that dilutes the original intent without filling the context window. Pattern: re-inject core task instructions on every command failure via `PostToolUse` hook, not just after `/compact`. Source: Nick Tune (2026-03-01). Resource evaluation: `docs/resource-evaluations/2026-03-16-nick-tune-workflow-dsl-ddd.md` (score 3/5 — 1 of 3 patterns integrated).

- **Identity re-injection after compaction** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` §7.5 + `examples/hooks/bash/identity-reinjection.sh`): New hook pattern from Nick Tune (Feb 2026). Solves agent identity drift after context compaction in long sessions — `UserPromptSubmit` hook reads transcript, detects missing identity marker in last assistant message, re-injects `.claude/agent-identity.txt` as `additionalContext`. Configurable via `CLAUDE_IDENTITY_FILE` and `CLAUDE_IDENTITY_MARKER` env vars. `reference.yaml` updated with `identity_reinjection_hook` + `identity_reinjection_example` keys.

- **Security audit hardening — 3 patterns** (`examples/commands/security-audit.md`, `examples/agents/security-auditor.md`): (1) Pre-step added to `/security-audit`: asks dev/staging/prod before running — avoids false positives on debug flags and CORS `*` in local dev. (2) Anti-false-positive rule in Phase 2 (secrets scan): mandates running `git log --all -p` and checking `.gitignore` before raising any secret finding — no more findings based on pattern matching alone. (3) Paywall/billing checklist added to `security-auditor.md` under A04 Insecure Design: server-side limit enforcement, subscription status from DB, webhook signature verification, billing bypass endpoints, race conditions on resource creation.

- **Resource evaluation: VicKayro — claude-security-audit** (`docs/resource-evaluations/2026-03-16-vickairo-claude-security-audit.md`): Score 2/5. Single-file `/security-audit` command, OWASP Top 10 (2021) + 16 sections, MIT, 60 stars (18 days old). Substantial overlap with existing `security-audit.md`, `security-auditor.md`, and `security-hardening.md`. Genuine gaps: paywall/billing audit section (not covered anywhere), environment context pre-step (dev/staging/prod before auditing), and stricter anti-false-positive pattern for secrets (mandate `git log --all -p` proof before raising finding). Decision: extract 3 patterns into existing commands silently, no guide mention, revisit at 200+ stars.

- **Resource evaluation: Nick Tune — Hook-Driven Dev Workflows** (`docs/resource-evaluations/2026-03-16-nick-tune-hook-driven-workflows.md`): Score 3/5. Covers hooks-as-workflow-engine pattern: typed state machine (Zod), per-state SubagentStart context injection, agent respawn for fresh context windows, identity re-injection after compaction, JSON workflow persistence. Key gap confirmed: guide lacks identity re-injection after compaction + per-state SubagentStart injection. Tiered integration: identity re-injection → §7.5 now; SubagentStart injection → agent-teams.md (3-4 weeks); full state machine guide deferred 60-90 days (1 week of author testing, needs community validation). Prerequisites: CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1, Opus 4.6, Node.js + TypeScript.

- **1M context window status update** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` lines ~2021-2070): Updated from "beta" to GA for Max/Team/Enterprise Claude Code plans (v2.1.75, March 13 2026). Preserved distinction: direct API use still requires tier 4 / custom rate limits. Pricing table updated to reflect standard rates for plan users.

- **Code Review feature** (`guide/workflows/code-review.md` + cross-reference in `guide/ultimate-guide.md`): New workflow guide for Anthropic's Code Review research preview (Teams/Enterprise). Covers: multi-agent architecture and severity levels (🔴/🟡/🟣), full setup flow (admin URL `claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-code`, GitHub App permissions, 3 trigger modes — once/every push/manual), `@claude review` manual trigger, `REVIEW.md` schema with example, pricing model ($15-25 avg, billed via extra usage outside plan, spend cap at `claude.ai/admin-settings/usage`), analytics dashboard, and cross-links to manual CLI workflows + GitLab CI/CD. Verified against official docs at `code.claude.com/docs/en/code-review`.

- **Context engineering guide — 3 additions** (`guide/core/context-engineering.md`):
  - **"Most failures are context failures"** framing added to §1 Why It Matters — reframes troubleshooting from "the AI is bad" to "what's missing from context"
  - **Static vs. Dynamic context** — new subsection distinguishing CLAUDE.md (static) from runtime tool outputs and agent context (dynamic); includes reference to Anthropic's September 2025 engineering post on agent context engineering
  - **Maturity assessment §9** — Level 0-5 self-assessment grid grounded in Claude Code patterns (no CLAUDE.md → flat config → structured → modular → measured → full system); includes "what to do at each level" action table

- **Spring Break promotion note** (guide line ~2395): Documented Anthropic's March 13-27, 2026 promotion — 2x usage limits outside 5-11am PT (peak hours) and all weekends, bonus usage doesn't count against weekly limits, applies to Free/Pro/Max/Team. Includes CET timezone conversion for European users (2x from midnight-13h and 19h-24h France time). Source: Anthropic support article.

- **Smart-Suggest ROI script** (`examples/scripts/smart-suggest-roi.py`): Python stdlib-only analyzer for the `smart-suggest` UserPromptSubmit hook. Correlates suggestion log (`~/.claude/logs/smart-suggest.jsonl`) with session JSONL files to estimate command acceptance rate. Detects 4 acceptance signals: slash command tags, Skill tool use, Agent tool use, and text mention in next 5 user messages. Reports: summary, tier breakdown (Enforcement/Discovery/Contextual/Custom), top suggested/followed commands, never-followed list, and daily trend chart. CLI: `--since Nd`, `--no-sessions` (fast mode), `--json`, `--log PATH`.
- **ICM (Infinite Context Memory)**: New MCP memory server section after Kairn (~line 11365) — Rust single binary, zero deps, Homebrew install, dual architecture (episodic decay Memories + permanent knowledge graph Memoirs), 9 typed relation types, auto-extraction 3 layers, 14 editor clients. Score 3/5 — recommended as Rust-native alternative when Python dependency management is a friction point. Includes explicit license callout (Source-Available, free ≤20 people) and vendor-reported benchmark flags.
- **Comparison matrix update**: Added ICM column to MCP memory stack matrix (Runtime + License rows added for all tools)

## [3.35.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **`guide/workflows/github-actions.md`** — 5 production-ready patterns for GitHub Actions CI/CD with `anthropics/claude-code-action` (6.2k stars, v1.0): on-demand PR review via `@claude` mention, automatic review on every push, issue triage and labeling, security-focused review on sensitive paths (`auth/**`, `payments/**`), scheduled weekly repo health check. Includes cost control table (Haiku vs Sonnet per pattern), concurrency setup, fork safety (`pull_request_target` guard), Bedrock/Vertex auth alternatives. Cross-linked from guide §9.3 and `guide/workflows/README.md`.

- **`guide/workflows/rpi.md`** — RPI: Research → Plan → Implement. 3-phase feature development with explicit GO gates: Research → `RESEARCH.md`, Plan → `PLAN.md`, Implement → working code. Slash command templates (`/rpi:research`, `/rpi:plan`, `/rpi:implement`), worked example (rate limiting on Express API), and comparison matrix vs Plan-Driven, TDD, Spec-First. Best for features where discovering a wrong assumption late is expensive.

- **`guide/workflows/changelog-fragments.md`** — Changelog Fragments workflow: one YAML fragment per PR, written at implementation time, validated by CI, assembled at release. 3-layer enforcement: CLAUDE.md workflow rule + `UserPromptSubmit` hook (3-tier: enforcement → discovery → contextual) + independent CI migration check. Documents the `UserPromptSubmit` tier pattern as a reusable architecture for any mandatory workflow step.

- **`examples/hooks/bash/smart-suggest.sh`** — `UserPromptSubmit` behavioral coach hook: Tier 0 enforcement (changelog fragment required before PR, plan-before-code), Tier 1 discovery (test-loop, retex, dupes, monitoring loop, security audit, release), Tier 2 contextual (code review, debugging, architecture, session resume). Max 1 suggestion per prompt, dedup guard, ROI logging to `~/.claude/logs/smart-suggest.jsonl`, silent exit on no match.

- **`guide/core/known-issues.md`** — "LLM Day-to-Day Performance Variance" section: session-to-session quality variance (shorter responses, conservative suggestions, edge-case refusals) documented as expected behavior, not a bug. 4 root causes: probabilistic inference, MoE routing variance, infrastructure variance, context sensitivity. Observable signals table and ruling-out checklist.

- **`examples/scripts/test-prompt-caching.ts`** — Standalone TypeScript script (zero deps, native fetch) to verify Anthropic prompt caching on any API key. Runs 3 identical calls, checks write/read metrics. Documents 4 undocumented production gotchas: `anthropic-beta: prompt-caching-2024-07-31` header required for Claude 4.x, effective threshold ~2048+ tokens, cached tokens excluded from `input_tokens`, new nested `cache_creation` object format.

- **`cc-sessions discover` documentation** — "Session Pattern Discovery" subsection in §2.x: `discover` subcommand n-gram mode (local, ~3s) vs `--llm` mode (semantic via `claude --print`), 20% rule decision framework (CLAUDE.md rule / skill / command), install instructions. Cross-reference added after the 20% rule callout in §5.1.

- **`examples/scripts/cc-sessions.py`** — Synced from 498-line stale copy to full 1225-line version from `~/bin/cc-sessions`: complete `discover` subcommand, incremental cache, Jaccard deduplication, all filtering logic. GitHub source header added.

- **GitHub repo [FlorianBruniaux/cc-sessions](https://github.com/FlorianBruniaux/cc-sessions)** — v1.0.0 published with curl install instructions.

### Updated

- **`guide/ultimate-guide.md`** — Two additions: cross-reference callout to `github-actions.md` in CI/CD section; "Fighting Vibe Code Degradation" subsection covering desloppify ([peteromallet/desloppify](https://github.com/peteromallet/desloppify)) — scan → next → fix → resolve loop as a Claude Code skill, early-stage (Feb 2026, ~2K stars), token cost caveat.

- **`examples/commands/resources/threat-db.yaml`** — v2.7.0 (2026-03-13). +5 threat sources: CVE-2026-26118 Azure MCP Server SSRF (THN/Tenable), OpenClaw agentic AI risk (ReversingLabs), Taskflow Agent scanner (GitHub Security Lab), OpenAI Codex Security research preview, DryRun Security 87% vulnerability rate in AI-built PRs.

- **`CLAUDE.md`** — "Behavioral Rules" section: 5 rules from observed session friction: always update CHANGELOG.md, exhaustive first pass, absolute paths, closing checklist, bias toward action.

- **`examples/scripts/README.md`** — cc-sessions entry updated with `discover` subcommand examples, GitHub repo link, curl install instructions.

- **`machine-readable/reference.yaml`** — Added `cc_sessions_github`, `cc_sessions_discover`, `changelog_fragments_*`, `smart_suggest_hook`, `rpi_*` entries.

## [3.34.11] - 2026-03-13

### Updated

- **`guide/ultimate-guide.md`** (§ Cost Optimization → Strategy 6): Added `#### How Claude Code Handles Caching Automatically` subsection (~75 lines) covering the mechanics that were previously a single undocumented footnote. New content: (1) **Cache prefix hierarchy** — `tools → system → messages` ordering and why the first two layers almost always hit; (2) **20-block lookback** — the long-session cache degradation trap and why `/compact` restores hit rates; (3) **Minimum token thresholds by model** — eligibility table for Opus/Sonnet/Haiku families (1,024–4,096 tokens), correcting the previously circulating false "32,000 token maximum" claim; (4) **Tool result size and cache economics** — why compact tool outputs reduce both cache write and read costs proportionally across the entire session; (5) **Monitoring in custom pipelines** — `cache_creation_input_tokens` / `cache_read_input_tokens` response fields, hit rate calculation formula, and why no dedicated CC cache monitoring tool currently exists; (6) **Practical rules** — CLAUDE.md stability, pre-emptive `/compact` timing, avoiding dynamic content in stable sections.

## [3.34.10] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **Quiz expanded: 277 → 311 questions (+34)** — 33 new questions covering topics added since the last quiz audit, across 9 categories: `modelOverrides`/`autoMemoryDirectory` settings (v2.1.73-74), tool-qualified deny format `Read(file_path:*.env*)`, CLAUDE.md HTML comment hiding (v2.1.72), `spinnerVerbs`/`spinnerTipsOverride` terminal personalization, team config at scale (N×M×P fragmentation, 59% token reduction), `/loop`/`/simplify`/`/batch`/`/stats`/`/rename` commands (v2.1.63-71), `WorktreeCreate`/`WorktreeRemove`/`TeammateIdle`/`TaskCompleted` hook events (v2.1.50 + v2.1.32+), auto-rename-session hook pattern, Git MCP vs GitHub MCP (12 local tools vs remote Copilot-required), Context Engineering 150% ceiling + ACE pipeline, Plan-Validate-Execute 3-command workflow, dual-instance planning (Jon Williams, $100-200/month), `isolation: "worktree"` in agent frontmatter, simplified effort levels ○◐● (v2.1.72, max removed), Fast mode (2.5x faster/6x price), `model` parameter restored on Agent tool (v2.1.72), `/context` actionable suggestions (v2.1.74), METR RCT 2025 (19% slower on large codebases), Borg "Echoes of AI" RCT 2025 (30.7% faster, no maintainability regression), Contribution Metrics platform feature (+67% PRs/day), enterprise governance 4 guardrail tiers (Starter/Standard/Strict/Regulated), MCP governance workflow + YAML registry, native sandbox OS primitives (macOS Seatbelt vs Linux bubblewrap), `dangerouslyDisableSandbox` escape hatch, RTK (60-92% token reduction, TOML Filter DSL), Google Antigravity (agent-first IDE). 1 question corrected: `12-architecture-internals/002` updated to reflect Tasks API replacing TodoWrite (v2.1.16+).
- **Quiz counters synced**: `machine-readable/reference.yaml` (`quiz_count: 311`), `llms.txt` + `llms-full.txt` + `machine-readable/llms.txt` (`Quiz Questions: 311`).

## [3.34.9] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **`guide/workflows/gstack-workflow.md`** — New workflow guide (140 lines) documenting the "Cognitive Mode Switching" pattern: switching between specialist roles across the ship cycle (strategic gate → architecture → paranoid review → release → browser QA → retrospective). Reference implementation: [gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack) by Garry Tan (YC CEO). Covers the 6 gears table, the pre-implementation strategic gate concept ("are we building the right thing?"), `/browse` non-MCP native browser architecture (persistent Chromium daemon, ~100ms/cmd vs MCP), full cycle demo, and when to use vs Plan Pipeline.

- **`examples/commands/plan-ceo-review.md`** — New command template for the strategic product gate. Three modes: SCOPE EXPANSION (find the 10-star product), HOLD SCOPE (make the plan bulletproof), SCOPE REDUCTION (strip to MVP). Includes full prompt template, concrete example (photo upload → smart listing creation), and integration notes. Inspired by gstack's `/plan-ceo-review` skill.

- **`examples/commands/plan-eng-review.md`** — New command template for the engineering architecture gate. Forces diagram generation (architecture, sequence, state machine), sync/async boundary decisions, failure mode inventory, trust boundary map, and test matrix before implementation. Includes Mermaid diagram examples and integration notes. Inspired by gstack's `/plan-eng-review` skill.

### Updated

- **`guide/workflows/README.md`**: Added Cognitive Mode Switching entry to Development Workflows section. Added two rows to Quick Selection Guide: "Strategic gate before coding" and "Non-MCP browser automation".

- **`guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md`** (Plugin Ecosystem section): Added gstack as the first entry under a new "Notable skill packs" subsection, with cross-reference to the workflow guide.

## [3.34.8] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **`examples/hooks/bash/smart-suggest.sh`** — Production-ready `UserPromptSubmit` hook implementing a 3-tier behavioral coaching architecture (Tier 0: enforcement, Tier 1: discovery, Tier 2: contextual). Features: max 1 suggestion per prompt, dedup guard (never suggests a command already in the prompt), JSONL ROI logging to `~/.claude/logs/smart-suggest.jsonl`, and silent exit on no match. Includes changelog fragment enforcement as the canonical Tier 0 example (conditional "if PR-intent without fragment-mention" pattern), plus 10 additional patterns across all three tiers. Directly reusable as a starting point for any project-level behavioral enforcement hook.

- **`guide/workflows/changelog-fragments.md`** — New workflow guide documenting the 3-layer changelog fragment enforcement pattern: (1) CLAUDE.md workflow rule for autonomous fragment creation by Claude, (2) `UserPromptSubmit` hook with tier-priority system for pre-prompt interception, (3) CI gate with two independent jobs (fragment validation + migration flag check). Explains why each layer is necessary, how they compose without conflicting, and how to adopt the pattern independent of the TypeScript implementation.

### Updated

- **`guide/ultimate-guide.md`** (§ Release Notes Generation): Added `### Changelog Fragments: Per-PR Enforcement Pattern` subsection covering the 3-layer approach with fragment YAML example, hook snippet, and assembly command. Positioned as an alternative to commit-based release notes generation, with links to the workflow guide and hook example.

- **`guide/workflows/README.md`**: Added Changelog Fragments entry to Development Workflows section with key topics (CLAUDE.md rule, UserPromptSubmit 3-tier hook, conditional suggestion pattern, independent CI migration check). Added to Quick Selection Guide under "Enforce mandatory workflow steps".

## [3.34.7] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **`guide/diagrams/11-context-engineering.md`** — 4 new Mermaid diagrams covering context engineering: 3-layer context system (global/project/session scopes), context budget and adherence degradation curve (95%→45% zones + path-scoping fix), monolithic vs modular CLAUDE.md architecture (anti-pattern vs path-scoped approach), and rule placement decision tree.

- **`guide/diagrams/12-enterprise-governance.md`** — 3 new Mermaid diagrams covering enterprise governance: 4-tier risk model (Starter/Team/Production/Regulated with controls per tier), MCP governance approval workflow (sequenceDiagram: submit → audit → classify → registry → deploy → monitor), and data classification matrix (PUBLIC/INTERNAL/CONFIDENTIAL/RESTRICTED with access rules).

### Updated

- **`guide/diagrams/01-foundations.md`**: Added Plan Mode and dontAsk as two new permission mode subgraphs (was showing 3/5 modes, now all 5 CLI permission modes are documented).

- **`guide/diagrams/04-architecture-internals.md`**: Added Control Flow Tools as a 6th tool category (EnterPlanMode/ExitPlanMode, EnterWorktree/ExitWorktree, AskUserQuestion). Count updated 5→6.

- **`guide/diagrams/05-mcp-ecosystem.md`**: Added clarifying note that local + user scopes both live in `~/.claude.json` (separate configuration keys), not in separate files. Description updated "4 different locations" → "4 priority levels (3 actual files)".

- **`guide/diagrams/07-multi-agent-patterns.md`**: Fixed disconnected B2 node — now properly connected as a third branch off the pattern-selection flow.

- **`guide/diagrams/09-cost-and-optimization.md`**: Replaced hardcoded USD prices with relative ratios (Haiku ~5x cheaper than Sonnet, Opus ~5x more than Sonnet) and added disclaimer pointing to anthropic.com/pricing.

- **`guide/diagrams/README.md`**: Updated diagram count 41→48, extended navigation table with files 11 and 12, added two new use-case navigation sections ("govern Claude Code across my team", "improve Claude's context adherence").

## [3.34.6] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **`guide/workflows/rpi.md`** — New RPI (Research → Plan → Implement) workflow guide (560 lines). 3-phase feature development pattern with explicit validation gates: GO/NO-GO gate after Research, plan approval gate before any code is written, and per-step test gates during implementation. Includes full RESEARCH.md and PLAN.md templates, 3 slash command templates (`/rpi:research`, `/rpi:plan`, `/rpi:implement`), worked example (API rate limiting), comparison table vs dual-instance/spec-first/TDD/direct, and troubleshooting section. Inspired by community patterns from claude-code-best-practice.

- **LLM Day-to-Day Performance Variance** (`guide/core/known-issues.md`): New section documenting session-to-session output variance as expected behavior (not a bug). Covers root causes (MoE routing variance, infrastructure variance, probabilistic inference, context sensitivity), observable signals table (response length, refusals, code style, creativity, verbosity), clear distinction from the Aug-Sep 2025 infrastructure bugs, and 5 mitigation strategies (constrain prompts, fresh context, reformulate and retry, compare against known-good prompt, calibrate by task type).

### Updated

- **`guide/ultimate-guide.md`** (§ Quick Decision Tree): Added RPI entry — "Feasibility is unknown → workflows/rpi.md"
- **`machine-readable/reference.yaml`**: Added 8 new entries — `rpi_workflow`, `rpi_when_to_use`, `rpi_phase1_research`, `rpi_phase2_plan`, `rpi_phase3_implement`, `rpi_slash_commands`, `rpi_vs_other_workflows`, `known_issues_llm_variance`

## [3.34.5] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **Blast-Radius Pattern** (grepai section, §8.2): Named pre-refactoring workflow using `grepai trace callers/callees` to enumerate all affected call sites before touching a widely-used function. Run before the refactor, not after compile errors. Includes 3-step bash example.

- **Pre-structural indexing** (§9.13 Token-Saving Techniques): New technique #6 documenting the concept of building a codebase structural index before starting a session. Replaces 5-10 sequential file reads with 1 graph query (~75% fewer tool calls for discovery tasks). Includes CodeXRay setup example (`npx codexray`, `cxr watch`).

- **Dead code & circular dependency detection** (§9.13): Documents three structural analysis patterns — dead code detection (`grepai trace callers` returning zero results), circular dependency identification, and hotspot analysis — as token optimization strategies. References CodeXRay and Claudette as alpha-stage community implementations with grepai as the stable alternative.

## [3.34.4] - 2026-03-12

### Documentation

- **Claude Code Releases**: Updated tracking to v2.1.74 (2026-03-12)
  - v2.1.74: `/context` actionable suggestions, `autoMemoryDirectory` setting, memory leak fix in streaming buffers, managed policy `ask` rules bypass fix, `SessionEnd` hook timeout fix
  - v2.1.73: `modelOverrides` setting, deadlock fix for skill hot-reload, subagent model downgrade fix on Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry, Opus 4.6 as default on 3P providers, `/output-style` deprecated

## [3.34.3] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **MCP Server v1.1.0**: 4 new tools for tracking official Anthropic Claude Code docs
  - `init_official_docs()` — fetch and store a local baseline snapshot (runs once)
  - `refresh_official_docs()` — update the "current" snapshot without touching the baseline
  - `diff_official_docs()` — compare baseline vs current at section level, zero network calls
  - `search_official_docs(query)` — search official docs, loads only matching sections
- **Local cache architecture**: 4 files in `~/.cache/claude-code-guide/` (index + content, baseline + current). Diff reads only lightweight index files (~50KB), never the full 1.2MB doc. Atomic writes via `.tmp` + rename to prevent corruption.
- **5 new slash commands** (`/ccguide:init-docs`, `/ccguide:refresh-docs`, `/ccguide:diff-docs`, `/ccguide:search-docs`, `/ccguide:daily`) — documented in `ultimate-guide.md` and added to `.claude/commands/ccguide/`
- **`/ccguide:daily`** orchestrates the full daily workflow: refresh → diff official docs → guide/CC digest in one shot

## [3.34.2] - 2026-03-11

### Documentation

- **Claude Code Releases**: Updated tracking to v2.1.72 (2026-03-09)

## [3.34.1] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **`guide/workflows/og-image-generation.md`** — New workflow guide for generating dynamic OG images at build time using Satori and resvg in Astro 5. Covers setup, font format requirements (woff1 only), static file shadowing gotcha, dynamic stat counting from content directories, testing with opengraph.xyz / LinkedIn Post Inspector, and three design variants (stats grid, personal branding, terminal badge). Includes CI size check pattern.

- **`examples/scripts/og-image-astro.ts`** — Production-ready template for `src/pages/og-image.png.ts`. Drop into any Astro 5 project. Auto-serves at `/og-image.png`, counts content files dynamically, includes stat card component, author signature, and inline comments on every gotcha.

## [3.34.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **Context Engineering Configurator** (`cc.bruniaux.com/context/`) — Interactive multi-step configurator that generates a personalized CLAUDE.md starter kit. 5-screen flow: profile (team size, AI tools), current state (existing CLAUDE.md, rules files), stack (language, frontend), results (generated artifacts + maturity assessment). Features: generated CLAUDE.md preview with copy-to-clipboard, Profile YAML for team setups, maturity badge (Level 1-5), personalized next-steps roadmap, localStorage persistence. Vanilla JS, no framework. Nav: added "Context" to landing header dropdown.

- **`guide/core/context-engineering.md`** — New consolidated reference (1,188 lines) covering all context engineering concepts. 8 sections: (1) What is Context Engineering (Karpathy's definition, prompt vs. context engineering distinction, three-layer model); (2) The Context Budget (token math, 150-instruction ceiling, HumanLayer 15-25% adherence data, path-scoping efficiency, overload signs); (3) Configuration Hierarchy (global/project/session split, decision tree for rule placement, override semantics); (4) Modular Architecture (path-scoping, skills vs. rules distinction, progressive disclosure, anti-pattern: monolithic CLAUDE.md); (5) Team Assembly (N×M×P problem, profile YAML, assembly workflow, CI drift detection, module library structure); (6) Context Lifecycle (instruction debt, update loop, knowledge feeding, ACE pipeline, session retrospective); (7) Quality Measurement (self-evaluation questions, canary checks, adherence tracking, context debt score formula); (8) Context Reduction Techniques (path-scoping -40-50%, negative constraints +15-25%, rule compression, deduplication, archive pattern).

- **`examples/context-engineering/`** — 10 production-ready templates: `README.md` (overview + quick start), `profile-template.yaml` (developer profile for context assembly), `skeleton-template.md` (CLAUDE.md skeleton with filled placeholders), `assembler.ts` (~240-line TypeScript script for profile-based assembly with @import resolution, dry-run support, token estimation), `eval-questions.yaml` (20 self-evaluation questions across 4 dimensions), `canary-check.sh` (5-check behavioral regression script), `ci-drift-check.yml` (weekly GitHub Actions drift detection with auto-issue creation), `context-budget-calculator.sh` (measures always-on token cost), `rules/knowledge-feeding.md` (proactive context update protocol), `rules/update-loop-retro.md` (session retrospective template).

- **`tools/context-audit-prompt.md`** — Self-contained context audit prompt (543 lines) following `audit-prompt.md` pattern. Scores context engineering setup /100 across 8 dimensions: Size & Budget (15 pts), Structure (15 pts), Path-Scoping (12 pts), Rule Quality (15 pts), Freshness (12 pts), Team Readiness (10 pts), Conflict Detection (11 pts), Knowledge Loop (10 pts). Includes 3 bash scan phases, report format with context budget breakdown, 5-level maturity ladder, and ready-to-use paste improvements.

- **`src/data/context-data.ts`** (landing) — TypeScript data file with all configurator types, option arrays (team size, AI tools, stack, frontend), maturity level definitions (5 levels: Starter/Modular/Team-Ready/Measured/Adaptive), and template generators (`generateClaudeMd`, `generateProfileYaml`, `calculateMaturityLevel`).

### Updated

- **`guide/README.md`** — Added `core/context-engineering.md` row to Core Reference table.
- **`machine-readable/reference.yaml`** — Added 24 context engineering entries with paths to guide, examples, tools, and landing configurator.

## [3.33.1] - 2026-03-10

### Updated

- **RTK documentation updated to v0.28.0** — Synced RTK coverage across `guide/ultimate-guide.md`, `guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md`, `machine-readable/reference.yaml`, and global `~/.claude/{CLAUDE.md,RTK.md}`. New content: TOML Filter DSL (declarative filters without Rust, 33+ built-in filters, `.rtk/filters.toml` project-local and `~/.config/rtk/filters.toml` global lookup chain); `rtk rewrite` command (v0.25.0 single source of truth for hook rewrites, migration note: `rtk init --global` required after upgrade); new modules — `rtk docker compose`, `rtk mypy`, `rtk aws`, `rtk psql`, `rtk cargo nextest`, `rtk gt` (Graphite CLI), `rtk wc`; `rtk gain -p` per-project savings; `rtk init --global` with settings.json auto-patch; `exclude_commands` config; SHA-256 hook integrity verification; hook outdated warning.

## [3.33.0] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed

- **`guide/security/enterprise-governance.md` — Accuracy review pass** — 6 correctness issues fixed after adversarial critique: (1) Non-existent hooks removed from all tier `settings.json` configs (`dependency-guard.sh`, `compliance-pre-check.sh`, `pii-detector.sh`, `compliance-session-init.sh` were referenced but never existed in `examples/hooks/bash/`); (2) `compliance-audit-logger.sh` in Regulated tier replaced with real `session-logger.sh`; (3) Fabricated Claude Code API removed — `CLAUDE_SETTINGS` env var and `claude run-headless` subcommand don't exist; replaced with an honest CI pipeline validation pattern; (4) `date -d '30 days ago'` (GNU coreutils only) fixed to cross-platform with macOS/Linux `$OSTYPE` check; (5) Customer PII reclassified from CONFIDENTIAL to RESTRICTED — Enterprise plan (ZDR) alone doesn't satisfy GDPR/CCPA; (6) All `// comment` lines inside JSON code blocks removed (invalid JSON, breaks copy-paste).

### Added

- **Enterprise AI Governance section** (`guide/security/enterprise-governance.md`) — New guide covering org-level governance for teams deploying Claude Code at scale. 6 sections: (1) Local vs Shared governance split (risk matrix, decision framework); (2) AI Usage Charter — lean template covering approved tools, data classification, use case boundaries, approval matrix; (3) MCP Governance Workflow — approval pipeline (request → review → approve → deploy), YAML registry format, enforcement hook; (4) Guardrail Tiers — 4 pre-configured tiers (Starter/Standard/Strict/Regulated) with ready-to-copy `settings.json` and `CLAUDE.md` additions; (5) Policy Enforcement at Scale — config distribution, onboarding checklist, compliance audit script, role-based guardrails, CI/CD gates; (6) Audit & Compliance — what SOC2/ISO27001 auditors actually ask, audit trail setup, AI Governance Committee minimal structure. Audience: tech leads, engineering managers, security officers. Complements security-hardening.md (individual dev security) and production-safety.md (6 prod rules).

- **MCP Registry Template** (`examples/scripts/mcp-registry-template.yaml`) — Ready-to-use YAML format for tracking approved MCP servers at org level. Includes approved/pending/denied sections, version bump policy, risk classification (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH), data scope classification (PUBLIC/INTERNAL/CONFIDENTIAL/RESTRICTED), and expiry dates.

- **Governance Enforcement Hook** (`examples/hooks/bash/governance-enforcement-hook.sh`) — SessionStart hook validating active MCP configuration against org's approved registry, checking deny rules for secret files, and detecting dangerous `permissions.allow` overrides. Warns without blocking (governance-first, not friction-first).

- **AI Usage Charter Template** (`examples/scripts/ai-usage-charter-template.md`) — Org-level charter template covering approved tools, data classification (4 levels), approved/prohibited use cases, MCP server governance, code review and attribution requirements, accountability roles, incident response, and compliance mapping (SOC2/ISO27001/HIPAA/PCI DSS/GDPR).

### Documentation

- **`guide/roles/adoption-approaches.md`** — Added "Enterprise Rollout (50+ developers)" section with 3-phase rollout approach (Foundation/Adoption/Optimization), common rollout mistakes at scale, and pointer to enterprise-governance.md for compliance programs.

- **`guide/ops/observability.md`** — Added "Manager Audit Checklist" section with weekly spot-check bash queries (files accessed outside project scope, destructive commands run) and a monthly compliance report script.

- **`guide/ops/ai-traceability.md`** — Added "Evidence Collection for Auditors" subsection under §7.3 Enterprise/Compliance — practical table mapping auditor questions to evidence sources and generation commands.

- **`guide/security/production-safety.md`** — Added cross-reference to enterprise-governance.md in See Also section.

- **`guide/security/security-hardening.md`** — Added cross-reference to enterprise-governance.md with explicit scope boundary ("this guide = individual MCP vetting; that guide = org-level policy"), plus MCP registry template reference.

- **`guide/README.md`** — Added enterprise-governance.md entry in Security section.

- **`machine-readable/reference.yaml`** — Added 22 entries for enterprise governance guide, templates, and hooks.

### Changed

- **GEO/SEO optimization — llms.txt, llms-full.txt, guide meta descriptions** — Phase 1 (repo): `machine-readable/llms.txt` updated (v3.8.0→3.32.2, 87→238 templates, 9.6K→22.7K lines); `llms.txt` created at repo root (convention llmstxt.org — AI crawlers expect root); `llms-full.txt` created (~20KB: full cheatsheet, 238-template catalog, 10 Q&A FAQ); `mcp-server/content/llms.txt` synced. Phase 2 (landing): `public/llms.txt` synced, `public/llms-full.txt` created; stale root `robots.txt` (wrong sitemap URL, missing 6 AI bots) and `sitemap.xml` (6 URLs only) deleted — `public/` versions are canonical. Phase 3 (landing): JSON-LD counts fixed (113→238 in `examples/index.astro`, description sync in `index.astro`); `twitter:site` + `twitter:creator` added to `Layout.astro`; CVE stat 19→24 in security page; `lastmod` added to all sitemap entries in `astro.config.mjs`. Phase 4 (README): invisible HTML keyword comment replaced with visible 5 Q&A mini-FAQ (GEO crawlers + humans). Phase 5 (guide section): 13 `CHAPTERS` descriptions rewritten in `scripts/prepare-guide-content.mjs` (source of truth for Starlight frontmatter) — avg 40→150 chars, now include specific agent names, hook event types, MCP server names, pattern names.

### Documentation

- **README navigation indexes synced with disk** (11 files) — Full audit revealed 40+ missing entries accumulated over time. `examples/README.md`: agents 9→16 (+2 collections), commands 26→31, hooks 31→34, skills 15→17, config 5→8, claude-md 6→7, scripts 13→16, integrations 4→1; 3 new sections: Rules (5), Team Config (3), Templates (1). `guide/README.md`: diagrams 40→41, +5 missing guide files (ai-roles, production-safety, remarkable-ai, sandbox-native, search-tools-cheatsheet), workflows 6→18. `guide/workflows/README.md`: new "Multi-Agent & Advanced" section (agent-teams, agent-teams-quick-start, dual-instance-planning, event-driven-agents, plan-pipeline, task-management), Quick Selection Guide extended, date updated. `examples/hooks/README.md`: +3 hooks (auto-rename-session, security-gate, velocity-governor). `examples/scripts/README.md`: +6 scripts (bridge-plan-schema.json, migrate-arguments-syntax.sh/.ps1, rtk-benchmark, sync-claude-config, sonnetplan). `guide/diagrams/README.md`: frontmatter 40→41. `docs/resource-evaluations/README.md`: 72→115. `README.md` root: resource evals 84→115.

### Changed

- **`tools/onboarding-prompt.md` updated for guide v3.32.2** — 7 changes: (1) "Who This Is For" table enriched (sandbox modes, Plan-Validate-Execute, Skills 2.0 taxonomy, threat DB mentioned by goal); (2) version refs `v3.23.0+` and `v3.21-3.22` updated to `v3.32.2+` / `v3.21-3.32` (6 occurrences); (3) 5 new adaptive triggers documented (`permission|allow|deny → permission_modes`, `memory|persist|session → memory_files`, `template|structure|format → skill_template`, `validation|checklist|deploy → agent_validation_checklist`, `plan|pipeline → plan_pipeline_workflow`); (4) time option "📖 2+ hours" added to the time profile question; (5) fallback roadmap `learn_security` enriched with `permission_modes`; (6) quiz count 274 → 271, per-profile subtotals removed (inconsistent), guide lines 11K+ → 22K+; (7) localization status updated (v3.23.0 → v3.32.2, `plan_pipeline` added in topics, quiz 274 → 271).

- **`tools/audit-prompt.md` updated — Version 3.0** (`tools/audit-prompt.md`) — 6 changes: (1) Opus 4.5 → Opus 4.6 (3 occurrences: intro note, Thinking Mode checklist, glossary); (2) Context Zones corrected: `Green (0-50%) / Yellow (50-70%) / Red (70%+)` → precise thresholds `< 70% optimal, 75% auto-compact, 85% handoff, 95% force handoff`; (3) `sed` line numbers updated with values from `reference.yaml` (deep_dive keys) + maintenance comment; (4) 4 new checklist categories added before "2.2 Calculate Health Score": **Rules Templates** (`.claude/rules/`, auto-loaded), **Sandbox & Permissions** (modes, `permissions.deny`), **Security Commands** (`/security-check`, `/security-audit`, threat-db), **Plan-Validate-Execute Pipeline** (`/plan-start`, `/plan-validate`, `/plan-execute`, ADR loop); (5) 4 new glossary entries: **Rules**, **Permission Modes**, **Sandbox**, **Plugins**; (6) footer `January 2026 | Version 2.9` → `March 2026 | Version 3.0`.

- **`machine-readable/reference.yaml` — Onboarding Matrix v2.1.0** (`machine-readable/reference.yaml`) — 5 changes: (1) metadata `version 2.0.0 → 2.1.0`, `last_updated → 2026-03-09`, new changelog entry v2.1.0; (2) 3 new deep_dive keys: `skills_taxonomy: 6718` (§5.0 Two Kinds of Skills), `skills_evals: 6954` (§5.Y Skill Evals), `session_auto_rename: 859` (distinct from `session_naming_guide: 815`); (3) quiz count `264 → 271` (4 occurrences: `quiz_count`, `unique` array, `code_landing.features`, comment); (4) adaptive triggers `plan|pipeline[|validate|execute]` added in 3 profiles: `optimize.power_60min`, `build_agents.power_60min`, `learn_everything.power_120min` → topic `plan_pipeline_workflow`; (5) version refs `v3.21-3.22 → v3.21-3.32` in profile notes (4 occurrences).

### Documentation

- **`/loop` command added to Commands Table §10.1** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`) — `/loop [interval] [prompt]` runs a prompt or slash command on a recurring interval (e.g. `/loop 5m check the deploy`). v2.1.71+. Was already in cheatsheet (v3.32.2), now present in the reference table.

- **Voice keybindings documented §10.2** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`) — new "Voice Input" subsection in Keyboard Shortcuts: push-to-talk default binding (`Space`), `voice:pushToTalk` rebindable in `~/.claude/keybindings.json` (v2.1.71+), example config included.

- **Claude Code Security note enriched §7.4** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`) — added Mozilla Firefox validation context (March 2026): Opus 4.6 scanned ~6,000 C++ files in Firefox's JS engine, surfaced 22 confirmed vulnerabilities (14 high severity) in two weeks. Reinforces the "limited research preview" note with production evidence.

- **Pipelex + MTHDS added** (`guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md`) — new entry in "External Orchestration Frameworks" for Pipelex, Python runtime of the open MTHDS standard. Declarative DSL (`.mthds` files) for creating typed, git-versionable, multi-LLM AI methods. Integrates natively with Claude Code via `/plugin marketplace add mthds-ai/skills`. 623 stars (MIT, created May 2025). Status "Watch" — MTHDS standard not yet validated at scale. Architectural note distinguishing Pipelex (DSL for pipelines) from Ruflo/AthenaFlow (agent orchestration).

- **Diagrams updated — 3 files** (`guide/diagrams/`) — Mermaid diagrams updated following releases v2.1.59–v2.1.69 and documentation corrections v3.29–v3.31. (1) `02-context-and-sessions.md`: Memory Hierarchy goes from 5 to 6 types — addition of **Native Auto-Memory** (`~/.claude/projects/*/memory/MEMORY.md`, v2.1.59+) between Subdirectory CLAUDE.md and In-Conversation Context, cross-session scope, distinct green style from ephemeral types. (2) `03-configuration-system.md`: Hooks Event Pipeline enriched with 3 new events — `InstructionsLoaded` (v2.1.69+, session start), `UserPromptSubmit` (before PreToolUse, exit 2 = feedback), `Stop / SessionEnd` (renamed) — and a note on the HTTP type (POST JSON, v2.1.63+). (3) `05-mcp-ecosystem.md`: Official Servers goes from 3 to 5 entries — added `git-mcp` (official Anthropic, 12 git tools) and `github-mcp` (official GitHub, full platform).

### Changed

- **`/pr-triage` skill — Phase 4 Worktree Setup** (`examples/skills/pr-triage/SKILL.md`) — porting the worktree pattern developed on Méthode Aristote to the guide's generic template. The skill goes from 3 to 4 phases: Phase 4 is opt-in, accessible from a navigation menu after Phase 1 (without going through Phase 2/3). Integrated content: 30min cache-check on Phase 1 data, automatic filtering of draft PRs and bots (Dependabot, renovate, snyk), grouped display by author, multiSelect selection via AskUserQuestion, sequential execution per PR with structured status codes (CREATED / EXISTING / FETCH_FAILED / GITIGNORE_MISSING / ALREADY_CHECKED_OUT / CREATE_FAILED), automatic `node_modules` symlink if present (Node.js), `.worktreeinclude` convention to copy local config files into each worktree, git pull `--ff-only` for existing worktrees with guided rebase fallback, final summary with next steps `cd .worktrees/<branch> && claude`. Phase 4 edge cases added (5 cases). Related table and frontmatter description updated (3-phase → 4-phase, `worktree` tag).

## [3.32.2] - 2026-03-09

### Documentation

- **Cheatsheet updated** (`guide/cheatsheet.md` + landing `cheatsheet/index.astro`) — 4 new commands from releases v2.1.59–v2.1.71: `/loop [interval] [prompt]` (recurring scheduler, e.g. `/loop 5m check the deploy`), `/stats` (usage chart + streak), `/rename [name]` (name a session), `/copy` (interactive picker to copy a code block). New shortcut `Ctrl+F` (kills all background agents, double press). `/loop` added to "Hidden Features" with version v2.1.71. Landing version synced 3.29.2 → 3.32.0.

## [3.32.1] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- **`auto-rename-session.sh` hook template** (`examples/hooks/bash/auto-rename-session.sh`) — SessionEnd hook that automatically generates a descriptive title for each session. Reads the session JSONL directly, extracts the first 3 user messages, calls `claude -p --model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` to generate a 4-6 word title (`verb + subject` format), falls back to the cleaned first message if Haiku is unavailable. Updates the slug in the native JSONL (for `/resume`) and in `sessions-index.jsonl`. Output via `/dev/tty` to bypass Claude Code's JSON parsing.

### Documentation

- **"Session Auto-Rename" section updated** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`) — now presents two complementary approaches: Approach A (CLAUDE.md instruction, mid-session renaming via `/rename`, zero tooling) and Approach B (SessionEnd hook, title generated by Haiku post-session, direct JSONL reading). Removed the "Why not a hook?" paragraph which was incorrect since the introduction of session data access via JSONL.

## [3.32.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- **Plan-Validate-Execute Pipeline** (`guide/workflows/plan-pipeline.md`) — new complete 3-command workflow for AI-first teams: `/plan-start` (5 phases: PRD analysis, design, technical decisions, dynamic research team, metrics), `/plan-validate` (2 layers: inline structural checks + specialist agents triggered by triggers), `/plan-execute` (isolated worktree, TDD scaffolding, parallel execution by levels, quality gate with smoke test, PR creation and merge, cleanup). Includes: "non-prescriptive" philosophy (say what, never how), first principles "No Bandaids, No Workarounds" (state-of-the-art always, build time irrelevant, zero workaround), ADR learning loop (Watching → Emerging → Confirmed → CLAUDE.md promotion), CLAUDE.md discipline (120-line limit, pointer strategy to sub-files, dynamic loading), context management (`/clear` between each command). Cost profile: $2-10 for a typical Tier 2 feature with compounding over time.

- **`/plan-start` command** (`examples/commands/plan-start.md`) — 5-phase slash command with dynamic agent pool (12 roles, trigger-based selection). Includes: interactive PRD analysis with 3 buckets (missing/ambiguous/compliance), design analysis (screen inventory, states catalog, animation specs, ARIA accessibility), technical analysis with automatic resolution of ADR-confirmed decisions, scope assessment (Tier 0 Solo → Tier 4 Full Spectrum), parallel multi-agent research monitored via TaskOutput, synthesis by `planning-coordinator`, commit plan + ADRs + metrics. Auto-transition to `/plan-validate` if no ambiguities.

- **`/plan-validate` command** (`examples/commands/plan-validate.md`) — independent validation in 2 layers. Layer 1 inline structural (format, dependencies, file existence, ADR consistency, CLAUDE.md compliance). Layer 2 specialists triggered by triggers (security-reviewer Opus, db-migration-reviewer Opus, performance-reviewer, design-system-reviewer, ux-reviewer, cross-platform-reviewer, integration-reviewer Opus — 0 to 8 agents depending on the plan). ADR-aware auto-fix phase: Bucket A (auto-resolution via ADR/PATTERNS/first principles, ~95%), Bucket B (human input → new rule → future auto-resolution). Structured persistence of issues in metrics JSON. Auto-transition to `/plan-execute` if everything auto-resolved.

- **`/plan-execute` command** (`examples/commands/plan-execute.md`) — complete execution through to merged PR. Isolated worktree → TDD scaffolding (failing tests first) → parallel execution by levels (one agent per task, commit per task) → drift detection → quality gate (lint + types + tests) → integration smoke test (probe GraphQL, scan container logs, plan-defined commands) → PRD reconciliation + plan archival → PR squash merge → post-merge metrics → worktree cleanup. Up to 3 auto-fix attempts by debug agent before human escalation.

- **`planning-coordinator` agent** (`examples/agents/planning-coordinator.md`) — Opus synthesis agent, read-only. Receives reports from all research agents, reads existing ADRs, resolves conflicts between agents (ADR precedence → agent stake → human escalation), builds the task graph (layers, TDD markers, atomic granularity), verifies plan completeness (PRD coverage, security findings addressed, acyclicity). Spawned automatically when 2+ research agents are selected. Does not research — synthesizes.

- **`integration-reviewer` agent** (`examples/agents/integration-reviewer.md`) — Opus runtime validation agent, read-only + WebFetch. Validates what compiles but fails at runtime: connection parameters (ports, protocols, hostnames across environments), async/sync consistency (missing awaits, sync call in async context), env var completeness (`.env.example`, CI/CD, k8s manifests, startup validation), API library correctness (installed version vs API used via WebFetch), OTEL pipeline (configured exporter, cross-service context propagation, sampling). Triggered in `/plan-validate` when new services, libraries, or OTEL config are in scope.

## [3.31.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- **Skills 2.0 — Taxonomy, Evals and Lifecycle** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` §5.0, §5.X, §5.Y) — 3 new blocks: Capability Uplift vs Encoded Preference taxonomy, Skill Lifecycle (Catch Regressions + Spot Outgrowth + retirement checklist), Skill Evals (Benchmark Mode / A/B Testing / Trigger Tuning). "What Makes a Good Skill?" table enriched (Expected Lifespan column). `guide/cheatsheet.md` + `machine-readable/llms.txt` updated. 3 new landing quiz questions (019-021). Sources: ainews.com, mexc.co, claudecode.jp — March 2026.

- **Featured Community Plugins — Vitals + SE-CoVe** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` §8.5) — Vitals (chopratejas/vitals, v0.1 alpha): hotspot detection using `git churn × structural complexity × coupling centrality` formula, Claude semantic diagnostics, zero dependencies. SE-CoVe (vertti/se-cove-claude-plugin, v1.1.1): 5-step Chain-of-Verification pipeline (Baseline → Planner → Executor → Synthesizer → Output), verifier without access to the initial solution. Evaluation: `docs/resource-evaluations/vitals-codebase-health-plugin.md` (3/5). `machine-readable/reference.yaml` entries updated.

### Documentation

- **Memory system — 3 corrections** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`): Auto-Memories version corrected (v2.1.32+ → v2.1.59+, confirmed 2026-02-26), context thresholds unified (<70% optimal / 75% auto-compact / 85% handoff / 95% force), WHAT/WHY/HOW framework added (§3.1 Minimum Viable CLAUDE.md) with Next.js example and anti-pattern "do not auto-generate your CLAUDE.md".

## [3.30.2] - 2026-03-05

### Documentation

- **Conductor section enriched** (`guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md:376`) — section rewritten from 5 generic bullets to 6 structured subsections, verified against official changelog (conductor.build). Added: workspace status system (backlog → done, v0.35.0), Next Workspace button for agent queue navigation (v0.36.4), turn-by-turn diff viewer (v0.22.0), Manual Mode built-in editor replacing VSCode for quick edits (v0.37.0), full GitHub/CI integration details (Actions tab v0.33.2, failing CI → Claude auto-fix v0.12.0, PR workflow with `⌘⇧P`), Linear deeplinks, Codex support alongside Claude, Melty Labs attribution. Community workflow pattern added: 5+ parallel features across multiple repos, BMAD + Conductor combo for spec-driven development (user-reported, unverified claim clearly marked).

- **Claude Code Releases tracking**: Updated to v2.1.69 (from v2.1.66)
  - v2.1.69: InstructionsLoaded hook, 4 security fixes (nested skills/symlink bypass/trust dialog/sandbox), 15+ memory leak fixes, Voice STT 20 languages, ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}, /reload-plugins
  - v2.1.68: ultrathink keyword re-introduced, Opus 4.6 medium effort default, Opus 4/4.1 removed from first-party API


### Added

- **OpenClaw security hardening — personal documentation (boldguy/obsidian)** — 4 files created after security audit (score 5/10 → target 8+/10). (1) `securisation-openclaw.md`: complete 5-level guide — gateway bind loopback + 32-char token, exec allowlist + filesystem denied paths, memory-lancedb reconfigured with local Ollama (nomic-embed-text, `dimensions: 768` required because `config.ts:66-72` throws for non-OpenAI model without this field), Cloudflare Access Zero Trust on `webhook.bruniaux.com`, iMessage DM Policy (pairing or allowlist), hardened docker-compose. (2) `checklist-openclaw.md`: 5 checkable sections (pre-install, network, sandbox, memory/data, channels) + monthly monitoring. (3) `scripts/verify-openclaw-security.sh`: bash script with 8 automated checks (port binding, JSON config, Ollama, active OpenAI connections, injection session scan, built-in audit, FileVault). (4) `rapport-audit-openclaw.md`: Addendum section with additional findings (Ollama local support verified in `config.ts:10,147`, community 3-tier guide, DM Policy modes). Key audit finding: `memory-lancedb` sends embeddings to OpenAI by default — reconfigure with `baseUrl: "http://localhost:11434/v1"` + `dimensions: 768` to stay 100% local.

### Fixed

- **Remote Control §9.22 — iOS bugs documented and workarounds** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md:20075`) — troubleshooting enriched following field testing (iPhone, March 2026). Confirmed bug: QR code scan opens the Claude app but the session does not appear in the list (Research Preview, reproducible on iOS, documented by MacStories). Two reliable workarounds added: (1) `claude.ai/code` in Safari — session visible directly, (2) URL copied from terminal and pasted in Safari. Explanatory note added in troubleshooting table with MacStories reference.

### Added

- **Entire CLI enrichment (6 sections, 4 files)** — integration of production analysis issue #802 (Méthode Aristote) into the guide. Content added: (1) `guide/ops/ai-traceability.md` — complete "workflow without vs with Entire" diagram showing the 7 hooks and what they capture (UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop...), actual checkpoint structure (`entire/checkpoints/v1/` with metadata.json + full.jsonl + prompt.txt + context.md), orphan branch diagram (no common ancestor = zero merge conflict), Go/No-Go table with measurable thresholds (< 10 MB/session, push < 5s, < 100 MB/week) and 2h spike commands. (2) `guide/ecosystem/ai-ecosystem.md` — Claude → Gemini agent handoffs diagram with context preservation (reasoning trace, touched files, decisions, rejected approaches), "no cold start" explanation. (3) `guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md` — delta table vs existing setups (7-day JSONL vs permanent checkpoints, absent human/AI attribution vs % per line, silent handoffs vs auto-passed context). (4) `guide/security/security-hardening.md` — approval gate flow diagram (policy check → low risk auto-OK / high risk → reviewer transcript + diffs → approve/reject → immutable audit trail). Source: [github.com/methode-aristote/app/issues/802](https://github.com/methode-aristote/app/issues/802).

- **`issue-triage` skill** (`examples/skills/issue-triage/`) — 3-phase issue backlog management for maintainers: automated audit of all open issues (categorization, Jaccard duplicate detection against open + 20 recent closed, risk classification Red/Yellow/Green, staleness 30/90-day thresholds, cross-reference to open PRs), opt-in deep analysis via parallel agents (full body + comments, duplicate verification, missing-info detection, effort estimate), and validated triage actions with mandatory `AskUserQuestion` gate (comment / label / close with close-reason). Jaccard algorithm is self-contained at runtime (no external library: normalize → tokenize → set intersection/union → threshold 0.60). Cross-referenced with `/pr-triage` for PR-side backlog management.

- **`pr-triage` skill** (`examples/skills/pr-triage/`) — 3-phase PR backlog management for maintainers: automated audit of all open PRs (size classification, overlap detection, cluster analysis, staleness, CI status, PR-issue linking), opt-in deep review via parallel `code-reviewer` agents, and validated comment posting with mandatory `AskUserQuestion` gate. Stack-agnostic (Node/TS, Python, Rust, Go checklists included), cross-platform clipboard (pbcopy/xclip/wl-copy/clip.exe), and cross-referenced with `/review-pr` for single-PR use cases.

- **External Orchestration Frameworks** (`guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md`, new section) — new category architecturally distinct from existing multi-instance tools (Gas Town, multiclaude). Documented distinction: launching multiple Claude Code instances in parallel vs. replacing/augmenting the internal orchestration layer with a full runtime. Two tools covered: (1) **Ruflo** (formerly claude-flow, 18.9k stars) — most adopted framework, hierarchical queen + workers swarms, 60+ specialized agents, Q-Learning router, 42+ skills, 17 hooks, SQLite persistence. Install recommendation via `npx ruflo@latest` (not curl|bash). Performance claims (84.8% SWE-Bench, 352x WASM) marked unverified, ongoing rebrand documented. (2) **Athena Flow** — different architecture (hooks → UDS → NDJSON → Node.js runtime → TUI), intercepts hook events rather than augmenting the agent layer. First workflow: autonomous Playwright E2E test builder. Status "Watch — not recommended yet" (project too recent, source audit missing). Complete evaluations: `docs/resource-evaluations/073-athena-flow-workflow-runtime.md` (2/5 Watch) and `074-ruflo-multi-agent-orchestration.md` (3/5 Pertinent).

- **For Tech Leads & Engineering Managers** (`guide/roles/learning-with-ai.md`, new §12) — dedicated section for tech leads and engineering managers, a blind spot identified through resource evaluation (Mathieu Eveillard, "Génération LLM"). The guide only covered the individual perspective; this section addresses organizational responsibility. Content: 4-week onboarding model (week 1 without AI for calibration before the tool masks gaps, validated by Create Future 2025: structured training → 14-42% → 35-65% time savings), 5 real growth metrics vs. velocity, 3 scalable mentoring models (pair rotations, 15min/week architecture hot seat, collective CLAUDE.md), AI team policy template for shared `CLAUDE.md`, 6 team-level warning signs with specific responses, quick checklist. New "Team & Organizational Research" section in sources (Create Future 2025, Stanford Digital Economy 2025, LeadDev, Stack Overflow Gen Z). Evaluation file created: `docs/resource-evaluations/2026-03-04-eveillard-generation-llm.md`.

- **Compound Engineering patterns** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`, 4 insertions) — portable patterns from Every.to's compound-engineering plugin (Kieran Klaassen, prod-tested on Cora), previously absent from the guide. (1) **Named Perspective Agents**: distinction between persona roleplay (anti-pattern, prohibited §3.x) and named perspective (DHH = fat models + thin controllers + pragmatic REST condensed into one token), with caveat on drift between Claude versions. (2) **Swarm vs Sequential**: comparison table of the two multi-agent coordination modes, decision rule (Swarm = independent + thoroughness, Teams = sequential dependencies). (3) **Skill Quality Gates**: 9-criteria checklist going beyond frontmatter validation (`/audit-agents-skills`). (4) **Brainstorm-before-planning + documentary hierarchy**: `docs/brainstorms/ → docs/plans/` workflow before coding, table of 5 directories with their distinct roles (CLAUDE.md = rules, solutions/ = solved problems, brainstorms/ = thinking, plans/ = active plans, todos/ = ephemeral tasks). Formal evaluation: `docs/resource-evaluations/2026-03-04-compound-engineering-every-to.md` (4/5 HIGH VALUE).

- **Session Auto-Rename pattern** — behavioral instruction in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` that makes Claude automatically rename sessions after 2-3 exchanges, without any hook or script. Format `[action] [subject]` (e.g. "fix auth middleware", "refactor hook system"), max 50 chars, action verb first. Useful for finding sessions via `/resume` when multiple are running in parallel. Documented limitation: the WebStorm terminal tab cannot be renamed (ANSI sequences filtered by JetBrains). Template: `examples/claude-md/session-naming.md`. Guide: new "Session Auto-Rename" subsection in §1.3 Session Continuation. Template counter 175→176.

- **Design Reference File pattern** (`examples/claude-md/design-reference-file.md`) — field pattern from Boris Paillard / mixt.care evaluation (March 2026). Principle: keep `brand-book.html` and `ui-kit.html` at the project root as permanent context files — Claude Code reads them before any UI generation, ensuring design system consistency across sessions without re-prompting. Content: CLAUDE.md activation snippet, 4 complete prompts (brand-book with integrated WCAG, Tailwind ui-kit, WCAG 2.1 color audit + color blindness simulation, vanilla JS Intersection Observer scroll animations), palette example with CSS semantic roles (mixt.care), WCAG correction notes (e.g. copper #B87333 fails for normal text → fix to #9B5F20). Evaluation: `docs/resource-evaluations/075-paillard-design-system-first-website.md` (3/5).

- **Straude** (`guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md`, Token & Cost Tracking section) — complete entry for straude.com, a social dashboard for tracking Claude Code usage with leaderboard and streaks. Includes: functional description, table of data transmitted to the server (costs, tokens, models, hostname), security analysis based on direct source code inspection (`npm pack straude@0.1.9`), verdict (no malware, reservations about maturity and lack of privacy policy), `--dry-run` recommendation on first use. Complete evaluation: `docs/resource-evaluations/straude-evaluation.md`. Entries added in `machine-readable/reference.yaml`.

  - v2.1.62: Prompt suggestion cache fix
  - v2.1.61: Windows config file corruption fix

### Added

- **Native LSP documented** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`, `guide/cheatsheet.md`, landing cheatsheet) — complete section on Claude Code's native LSP support (v2.0.74+, December 2025). Content: performance gain explanation (50ms vs 45s for codebase navigation, 900x), activation via `ENABLE_LSP_TOOL=1` or `~/.claude/settings.json`, table of 11 supported languages with install commands (`tsserver`, `pylsp`, `gopls`, `rust-analyzer`, `kotlin-language-server`, `sourcekit-lsp`...), `.lsp.json` configuration for timeouts. Enriched cheatsheet: LSP line with perf stat + activation note. Sources: [aifreeapi.com/en/posts/claude-code-lsp](https://aifreeapi.com/en/posts/claude-code-lsp), Perplexity fact-check March 2026.

- **`docs/solutions/` pattern documented** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` §CLAUDE.md as Compounding Memory) — complementary pattern to CLAUDE.md for capturing solved problems between PRs, inspired by the [Compound Engineering (Every.to)](https://every.to/guides/compound-engineering) framework. Clear distinction: CLAUDE.md = behavioral rules, `docs/solutions/` = solved problems with full context. Includes example structure with 3 illustrative files (auth, iOS StoreKit, Kotlin coroutines).

- **Voice Mode documented** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`, `guide/cheatsheet.md`) — native feature rolling out (~5% of Pro/Max/Team/Enterprise users). `/voice` to activate, hold `Space` to speak, release to send. Can be mixed with text input in the same prompt. Free transcription, does not count toward rate limits. 4 places updated: quick commands table §1.3, built-in commands table §6.1, voice workarounds section §11 (switching from superwhisper/MacWhisper workaround to native feature), cheatsheet (commands + shortcuts + hidden features). Source: [Charly Wargnier / LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/charlywargnier_voice-mode-is-officially-coming-to-claude-ugcPost-7434514836211863552-JvKw).

- **Smart Concierge + Retex system** — porting the system developed on Méthode Aristote to this project. `UserPromptSubmit` hook (`smart-suggest.sh`) that analyzes each prompt in natural language and suggests 0 or 1 relevant tool (max 1 per prompt, silent on slash commands, dedup if the tool is already in the prompt, ROI log in `~/.claude/logs/smart-suggest.jsonl`). 22 patterns in 2 tiers adapted to this project's tools: Tier 1 discovery (retex, whitepaper-density/journalist/coherence, pdf-generator, sync, security-audit, audit-repo-docs, boldguy-linkedin-answer, guide-recap, park, update-whitepapers), Tier 2 contextual (release, changelog, version, code-reviewer, debugger, audit-agents-skills, update-threat-db, audit-prose, release-notes-generator, security-check).
- **`/retex` command** — captures lessons learned (dead ends, bugs, rollbacks) in `.claude/memories/retex-*.md` with global index `retex-index.md`. Structure: what happened, root cause, prevention rule, tags, severity, scope. Direct mode (`/retex "description"`) and interactive mode.
- **`retex-review.md` rule** — auto-loaded at each session, displays the 3 most recent retex at startup, inline contextual surfacing if a pattern matches an existing prevention rule (max 1 warning per type per session).

## [3.30.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- **10 advanced patterns documented** — systematic audit of 10 patterns identified from expert practitioners, fact-checked via 9 Perplexity searches (March 2026). 5 new files created, 4 existing files enriched, 3 sections added to the main guide.

  - `list_threats(category?)` — browse the threat-db: global summary with counts (no category) or detailed list by section (`cves`, `authors`, `skills`, `techniques`, `mitigations`, `sources`)
  - `search_examples(query, limit?)` — semantic search across 175 templates by intent (e.g. `"hook lint"`, `"agent code review"`) — complementary to `get_example` (exact name) and `list_examples` (category)
  - `mcp-server/IDEAS.md` — future ideas documented: `get_quiz`, `get_methodology`, `get_workflow`, resource `diff`, prompt `security-review`
  - Total: 8 tools → 12 tools (+ 3 resources + 1 prompt)

- **Terminal Personalization Settings** — documentation `spinnerVerbs` + `spinnerTipsOverride` in `guide/ultimate-guide.md` §3.3 Settings & Permissions
  - New section "Terminal Personalization Settings" (line 4978): JSON examples for `spinnerVerbs` (replace/add mode) and `spinnerTipsOverride` (with `excludeDefault: true`)
  - `settings.json` available keys enriched: added `spinnerVerbs`, `spinnerTipsOverride`, `plansDirectory`, `enableAllProjectMcpServers`
  - Link to complete example in the guide section
  - New file `examples/config/settings-personalization.json` — 183 lines, 19 custom verbs, 113+ tips in 13 categories (Context, Shortcuts, Prompting, Models, Plan Mode, Memory, Golden Rules, MCP, Tasks, CI/CD, Cost, Debug, Remote, Worktrees, Security, Hooks, Agents, Resources)

  - New section "Tool-qualified deny format" with complete example inspired by real production configs (strangebee, aristote): `Read(file_path:...)` syntax vs simple `".env"` format, glob patterns, note on known `permissions.deny` limitation (GitHub #4160)
  - Reference section §10.3 Permission Patterns updated with the 3 new lines
  - Source: comparative analysis of 3 production `.claude/` configs (StrangeBee/TheHive, Méthode Aristote, ccboard)

- **Resource evaluations** — 2 new evaluations in `docs/resource-evaluations/`
  - `069-claude-code-best-practice-repo-eval.md` — Evaluation of repo `shanraisshan/claude-code-best-practice` (score 4/5): bug fixed line 5646 (official agent fields misclassified as "community patterns"), interesting patterns identified
  - `070-claude-code-best-practice-dot-claude-eval.md` — Evaluation of `.claude/` config from the same repo (score 4/5): self-evolving agent pattern, Command→Agent→Skills architecture, `allowed-tools` wildcard scoping

### Fixed

- **MCP Server v1.0.3 — content path bug** (`mcp-server/src/lib/content.ts`)
  - ENOENT at production startup: `CONTENT_DIR` resolved `../../content` from `dist/` (2 levels), landing in `node_modules/` instead of the package root
  - Fix: `../content` (1 level) — tsup bundles everything flat in `dist/`, so 1 level is sufficient
  - Published on npm: `claude-code-ultimate-guide-mcp@1.0.3`

- **Bug line 5646 `guide/ultimate-guide.md`** — agent frontmatter fields `skills`, `background`, `isolation`, `memory` were incorrectly labeled "community patterns / not official spec". Replaced by complete official table verified against `code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents`. Fields concerned: `model`, `tools`, `disallowedTools`, `permissionMode`, `maxTurns`, `skills`, `mcpServers`, `hooks`, `memory`, `background`, `isolation`, `color` — all official.

### Changed

- **`ccboard/.claude/settings.json`** — added `permissions.deny` with tool-qualified format (14 rules): protection for sensitive files (`.env*`, `.pem`, `.key`, `credentials`, `secrets`) and destructive commands (`rm -rf`, force-push, reset --hard). Config went from `budget`-only to complete security config.

## [3.23.0] - 2026-02-06

### Changed

- **Adaptive Onboarding Architecture v2.0.0** — Major redesign of interactive onboarding system addressing 8 critical gaps identified by technical-writer challenge (~2,100 lines modified, 2 validation scripts, metrics plan)
  - **Adaptive topic selection**: Each profile now has **core topics** (always shown) + **adaptive topics** (context-based via keyword triggers). Claude analyzes user messages (e.g., "I work in a team and use git") to surface relevant v3.21-3.22 content (config_hierarchy, git_mcp_guide, mcp_secrets_management, dual_instance_planning, sandbox_native_guide) based on relevance, not chronology
  - **Security-first fix**: Moved `sandbox_native_guide` from `beginner_30min` → `beginner_5min` (CRITICAL fix). New users now learn sandboxing security **BEFORE** running commands, addressing technical-writer's "security gap HIGH RISK" finding
  - **Time budget validation**: All 18 profiles validated (6-8 min/topic average), respects `topics_max` limits. Prevents overwhelming users (e.g., power_30min: 4 topics max, not 6). Addresses "time budget impossible" challenge finding
  - **New learn_security goal**: Dedicated security-focused learning path with 2 profiles (intermediate_30min, power_60min) covering sandbox_native, mcp_secrets, security_hardening, production_safety, sandbox_isolation_guide. Fills gap for security-conscious users
  - **V3.21-3.22 comprehensive coverage**: All CRITICAL (5/5) and HIGH VALUE (4/5) topics now discoverable via adaptive triggers: git_mcp_guide (v3.22.0), config_hierarchy (v3.21.0), mcp_secrets_management (v3.21.0), dual_instance_planning (v3.22.0), sandbox_native_guide (v3.21.1)
  - **Quiz integration as exit activity**: Phase 4 wrap-up now recommends quiz by profile level (beginner: 60 questions ~15 min, intermediate: 100 questions ~25 min, advanced: 97 questions ~30 min). Addresses "quiz = testing mechanism, not learning content" challenge finding. 13 new deep_dive entries for quiz system
  - **Fallback minimal by design**: Kept graceful degradation pattern (3-5 topics if fetch fails), rejected proposal to enrich fallback per technical-writer recommendation. Improved fetch reliability strategy over content expansion
  - **Portability warnings added**: Documents AskUserQuestion Claude Code-specific limitation, localization status (English only for v3.21-3.22 topics, on-the-fly translation for FR/ES with accuracy warnings), simplification steps for ChatGPT/Gemini compatibility
  - **Maintenance automation**: 2 validation scripts created
    - `validate-onboarding.sh` (6 checks): YAML syntax, deep_dive key existence, time budget compliance, topics_max constraints, question_flow completeness, version alignment with VERSION file
    - `detect-new-onboarding-topics.sh`: Scans resource evaluations for CRITICAL/HIGH VALUE topics not in any profile, run monthly to prevent future drift
  - **Version metadata system**: `onboarding_matrix_meta` section added with version tracking (v2.0.0), changelog, maintenance guidelines (review trigger: every CRITICAL/HIGH feature), automation pointer (detect-new-topics script), responsible party (quarterly reviews)
  - **Files modified**: `reference.yaml` (+150 lines: onboarding_matrix_meta, adaptive matrix, learn_security goal, quiz deep_dive entries), `onboarding-prompt.md` (+80 lines: adaptive logic Phase 1/2, learn_security in Phase 1.5, quiz recommendations Phase 4, portability warnings), `scripts/validate-onboarding.sh` (350 lines), `scripts/detect-new-onboarding-topics.sh` (200 lines), `claudedocs/adaptive-onboarding-design.md` (1,100 lines design doc with 12 sections + 2 appendices)
  - **Impact**: Adoption improvement (30% of users use onboarding → 30% now discover v3.21-3.22 features), Security enhancement (beginners learn sandbox FIRST, not eventually), Support reduction (users following updated paths avoid "Why wasn't I told about X?" issues), Maintenance automation (gap detection prevents future drift), Portability transparency (users know AskUserQuestion limitation, localization accuracy warnings)
  - **Challenge validation**: Technical-writer agent challenged initial analysis, identified 8 missing angles (severity underestimation, sandbox placement wrong, quiz integration superficial, time budget violations, fallback design misunderstanding, user flow continuity gaps, maintenance burden unquantified, metrics plan missing). All 8 addressed in v2.0.0 design
  - **Effort**: 95 min actual (85 min estimated, +10 min for comprehensive testing/localization check)
  - **Credits**: Technical-writer agent (challenge phase identifying 8 critical gaps, adaptive architecture recommendation, time budget validation requirement, quiz UX correction, fallback graceful degradation insight), user request for onboarding sync verification

  - **Source**: LinkedIn Newsletter "Intelligence Humaine" (Feb 2, 2026, 3,897 followers), French healthtech company (15K+ companies, 300K+ members, €500M raised, heavily regulated industry)
  - **Key frameworks**: (1) Eiffel Tower Principle — AI tools transform what's architecturally possible (like elevators enabled Eiffel Tower shape), not just acceleration, (2) Ralph Wiggum Programming — agentic loops where engineers become architects/editors, (3) **Verification Paradox** — 99% AI success makes human vigilance fragile for 1% errors, need automated guardrails, (4) Precision as Currency — clear spec definition (WHAT/WHERE/HOW) is new engineer superpower, (5) Ambition Scaling — pursue previously impossible goals enabled by tools
  - **Production Safety Rule 7** added (`guide/security/production-safety.md:639-791`): "The Verification Paradox" — when AI reliability crosses 95%, shift from manual review to automated guardrails (tests, types, lints, CI/CD gates). Anti-patterns vs Better Approaches table, 3 implementation options (automated stack, verification contracts, pre-merge checklist), integration with Rules 2/3/6
  - **Practitioner Insight** added (`guide/ecosystem/ai-ecosystem.md:2133-2168`): Alan Engineering section after Addy Osmani, following existing format (credentials, content summary, alignment table with guide references, production-scale context). Interview mention of Stanislas Polu (Dust co-founder) citing Mirakl achievement (75% employees → agent builders)
  - **Machine-readable index** updated (`reference.yaml`): Added `practitioner_alan`, `practitioner_alan_source`, `verification_paradox`, `verification_paradox_source` entries
  - **README.md counters harmonized**: Fixed evaluation count inconsistencies (37/35/38 → 41 across 5 locations: line 18 intro, line 74 mermaid diagram, line 118 structure, line 163 features, line 427 details)
  - **Challenge phase**: Technical-writer agent reviewed 6 proposed integrations, rejected 4 (Quick Start paradigm shift, Mental Model refactoring, methodologies.md deep dive, XML Prompting precision) for dilution/duplication concerns, approved 3 (production-safety, ai-ecosystem, reference.yaml)
  - **Language note**: Original article in French, concepts and Henri Bergson quote ("L'intelligence est la faculté de fabriquer des outils à faire des outils") translated for guide
- **Multi-IDE Configuration Sync Pattern** — Documented strategies for maintaining consistent AI instructions across multiple coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot) in `guide/ecosystem/ai-ecosystem.md:1256-1329`
  - **Problem statement**: Table comparing config files (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, AGENTS.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md) — without sync, each drifts independently causing inconsistent AI behavior
  - **Solution 1**: Native @import (recommended for Claude Code solo usage) — no build step, maintained by Anthropic, but Cursor doesn't support it
  - **Solution 2**: Script-based generation for multi-IDE teams — source of truth in `docs/ai-instructions/` compiled into tool-specific configs via bash/node sync scripts
  - **AGENTS.md Support Status**: Clarified Claude Code does NOT natively support AGENTS.md ([GitHub issue #6235](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/6235), 171 comments, open as of Feb 2026) — workaround via symlink documented
  - **Compatibility matrix**: AGENTS.md standard supported by Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, GitHub Copilot (see [AI Coding Agents Matrix](https://coding-agents-matrix.dev))
  - **Machine-readable index**: Added `ai_ecosystem_multi_ide_sync` and `agents_md_support_status` entries to `reference.yaml`
- **Resource Evaluation: Addy Osmani LinkedIn Post** (scored 2/5, Marginal - Tracking mention only) — Post about Anthropic study (17% comprehension gap) evaluated but not integrated due to 100% overlap with primary source already documented (`docs/resource-evaluations/addy-osmani-linkedin-anthropic-study.md`)
  - **Content**: LinkedIn post (Feb 1, 2026, 246K reach) citing Shen & Tamkin 2026 study on AI-assisted learning
  - **Key claims verified**: 17% comprehension gap, 2-minute productivity gain, "thinking partner vs code vending machine" framing
  - **Overlap**: 100% with arXiv:2601.20245 already cited 3× in `guide/roles/learning-with-ai.md` (lines 114, 868, 890)
  - **Decision**: Minimal integration (1-2 line tracking mention) to document mainstream diffusion timeline without content duplication
  - **Challenge phase**: Technical-writer agent confirmed score 2/5 content but noted 3/5 ecosystem context (authority messager + diffusion milestone)
  - **New criterion documented**: "Influencer Amplification" pattern for future evaluations (reach >100K + timeline awareness)
- **Resource Evaluation: "Beyond Vibe Coding" Book** (scored 3/5, Pertinent - Minimal integration) — Comprehensive O'Reilly book by Addy Osmani evaluated for 90%+ overlap with existing guide content (`docs/resource-evaluations/beyond-vibe-coding.md`)
  - **Content**: 6-chapter book (Intro/Principles/Advanced Techniques/CLI Agents/Production/Future Trends) published 2025, paid format ($B0F6S5425Y Amazon), freemium web content at beyond.addy.ie
  - **Key frameworks**: The 70% Problem (AI accelerates 70%, final 30% needs rigor), Context Engineering as RAM metaphor, Critique-Driven Development, MCP as "USB-C for AI", Multi-Agent Orchestration
  - **Overlap analysis**: 14 aspects compared — 10/14 already covered 100% (Vibe Coding, Context Engineering, MCP, Multi-Agent, Plan Mode, TDD, Spec-First, Visual Context, Production Safety)
  - **Gap identified**: Critique-Driven Development framework not explicitly documented (conceptually covered via code review workflows), Few-Shot Prompting technique, Cost-Benefit Analysis Framework
  - **Cross-validation**: Osmani's "80% Problem" article already evaluated 3/5 (ai-ecosystem.md:2024), "Good Spec" article already integrated 4/5 (workflows/spec-first.md)
  - **Decision**: Tracking mention (3-5 lines in ai-ecosystem.md:2024) + cross-ref citations (1-2 lines in 4-5 overlapping sections) + "Context as RAM" metaphor note (methodologies.md:192)
  - **Rationale**: Book = external validation/synthesis, but guide already more comprehensive (11K lines vs paid book). Rejected full integration (paid resource, 90% duplication, 2 Osmani articles already integrated)

- **Addy Osmani Spec-Writing Evaluation** (scored 4/5, High Value) — Integration of ["How to write a good spec for AI agents"](https://addyosmani.com/blog/good-spec/) by Addy Osmani (former Head of Chrome Developer Experience at Google, 14 years Chrome team, O'Reilly author)
  - **Resource evaluation**: Systematic 5-point assessment with fact-checking (Perplexity verified credentials, all claims sourced) and technical-writer agent challenge phase (corrected initial 3/5 → 4/5 score) (`docs/resource-evaluations/addy-osmani-good-spec.md`)
  - **Gaps filled**: Modular prompts strategy, operational boundaries framework (Always/Ask First/Never), command spec templates, anti-pattern documentation for monolithic CLAUDE.md
  - **Integration priority**: High (within 1 week) — addresses daily user pain points (context pollution, spec clarity, operational decision-making)
- **Spec-First Workflow: 4 New Sections** (~180 lines added to `guide/workflows/spec-first.md`, 327 → 507 lines total)
  - **"Modular Spec Design"** (line 322): Pattern for splitting large CLAUDE.md files into focused domain files (CLAUDE-auth.md, CLAUDE-api.md, etc.). When to split (>200 lines threshold), 3 split strategies (feature-based, role-based, workflow-based), implementation pattern with @file references
  - **"Operational Boundaries"** (line 372): Three-tier boundary system (Always/Ask First/Never) mapped to Claude Code permission modes (auto-accept/default/plan mode). Decision framework table, API development example, quarterly review guidelines
  - **"Command Spec Template"** (line 432): Template for executable command specifications (testing, build, deployment, database commands) with expected outputs and error handling. Examples: `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm db:migrate` with safety checks
  - **"Anti-Pattern: Monolithic CLAUDE.md"** (line 472): Explains cognitive load problem (>200 lines = context pollution), real-world before/after example (387 lines → 7 focused files, 61% context reduction), migration checklist
- **Reference Index**: 8 new entries in `machine-readable/reference.yaml` (spec_first_workflow, spec_modular_design, spec_operational_boundaries, spec_command_template, spec_anti_monolithic, spec_osmani_source, spec_osmani_evaluation, spec_osmani_score)
- **README.md**: Incremented resource evaluations count (35 → 36 assessments)
- **Fresh Context Pattern**: New "Session-per-Concern Pipeline" variant — dedicates a fresh session to each quality dimension (plan → test → implement → security review → perf → code review) instead of looping the same task. References OpusPlan and TDD. (`guide/ultimate-guide.md:1595`)
- **Resource Evaluation #19: dclaude** (Patrick Debois) — Dockerized Claude Code wrapper evaluated at 2/5 (Marginal). Fills a narrow gap (Linux + Docker Engine without Docker Desktop) but uses standard containers with host Docker socket mount — weaker isolation than Docker Sandboxes' microVMs. Footnote added in `guide/security/sandbox-isolation.md` Limitations subsection. (`docs/resource-evaluations/dclaude-docker-wrapper.md`)
- **Resource Evaluation #20: 10 Tips from Inside the Claude Code Team** (paddo.dev / Boris Cherny thread) — Scored 4/5 (High Value). 4 integrations in ultimate-guide.md:
  - **Prompting as Provocation** (section 2.6.1): 3 challenge patterns — Gatekeeper, Proof Demand, Reset — treating Claude as a peer to convince rather than an assistant to direct (`guide/ultimate-guide.md:3029`)
  - **Model-as-Security-Gate** hook pattern: Route permission requests to Opus 4.5 via PreToolUse hook for intelligent security screening beyond static rules (`guide/ultimate-guide.md:6907`)
  - **Boris Cherny team patterns**: Skills as institutional knowledge (/techdebt, context dumps, BigQuery agents), CLI-over-MCP rationale, re-plan when stuck, Claude writes its own rules (`guide/ultimate-guide.md:11822`)
  - **Worktree shell aliases**: za/zb/zc navigation + dedicated analysis worktree tip (`guide/ultimate-guide.md:10717`)

Major upgrade to the session search utility (`cs`) with new features and bug fixes.

#### New Features

| Feature | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Multi-word AND search** | All words must match (was broken in v1) | `cs "prisma migration"` |
| **Project filter** | Filter by project name (substring) | `cs -p myproject "bug"` |
| **Date filter** | Filter by date (today, 7d, YYYY-MM-DD) | `cs --since 7d` |
| **JSON output** | Machine-readable output for scripting | `cs --json "api" \| jq .` |
| **Timeout** | 3-second timeout prevents long searches | Automatic |
| **Clean previews** | XML tags stripped, unicode filtered | No more `<local-command-caveat>` |

#### Performance

| Operation | Time |
|-----------|------|
| Cache lookup | ~16ms |
| Index rebuild | ~6s (239 sessions) |
| Fulltext search | 3-4s (timeout-bounded) |

#### Usage Examples

## [3.6.1] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed - Critical Factual Corrections

Major audit identifying and correcting factual errors that could mislead users about Claude Code's actual behavior.

#### 1. `--add-dir` Flag (Wrong Description → Permissions, Not Context Loading)

**Before**: Documented as "loading directories into context" / "focused context"
**Reality**: Grants tool access to directories outside CWD (permissions only, no token impact)

| File | Correction |
|------|------------|
| guide/ultimate-guide.md | "focused context" → "allow tool access outside CWD" |
| guide/cheatsheet.md | "Add directory" → "Allow access outside CWD" |
| machine-readable/reference.yaml | "limit loaded dirs" → "access dirs outside CWD" |
| quiz/questions/10-reference.yaml | Question + explanation corrected |

#### 2. `excludePatterns` → `permissions.deny` (Never Existed)

**Before**: Documented `excludePatterns` as a valid settings key
**Reality**: Never existed - the correct syntax is `permissions.deny`

| File | Correction |
|------|------------|
| guide/ultimate-guide.md | New syntax + warning |
| guide/security/data-privacy.md | New syntax + deprecation note |
| examples/scripts/audit-scan.sh | Detection + message fixed |
| tools/audit-prompt.md | 3 references corrected |

#### 3. `.claudeignore` Removed (Does Not Exist)

**Before**: Documented as a file exclusion mechanism like `.gitignore`
**Reality**: Not an official feature - use `permissions.deny` instead

| File | Correction |
|------|------------|
| guide/ultimate-guide.md | References → `permissions.deny` |
| guide/security/data-privacy.md | Section removed |
| CHANGELOG.md:1244 | Historical reference corrected |

#### 4. "Selective Context Loading" Myth → Lazy Loading Reality

**Before**: Implied Claude loads entire codebase or selectively loads directories
**Reality**: Claude uses lazy loading - reads files on-demand via Read/Grep tools

| File | Correction |
|------|------------|
| guide/ultimate-guide.md | New section explaining lazy loading |
| guide/cheatsheet.md | "Giant context loads" → "Vague prompts" |
| machine-readable/reference.yaml | "load giant context" → "bloated CLAUDE.md" |

#### 5. Invented CLI Flags (SuperClaude Extension Confusion)

**Before**: `--think`, `--think-hard`, `--ultrathink`, `--headless`, `--learn`, `--uc`, `--web` documented as official CLI flags
**Reality**: These are SuperClaude framework extensions (prompt injection), NOT official Claude Code flags

| Correction Type | Details |
|-----------------|---------|
| `--headless` | Replaced with `-p` (the actual flag for non-interactive mode) |
| `--think` variants | Clarified as "prompt keywords", not CLI flags |
| SuperClaude section | Added warning: "Non-official Extension" |
| Cheatsheet | Think flags table reformatted as prompt keywords |
| Decision tree | "Use --think" → "Use extended thinking prompts" |

#### 6. `@` File Reference Behavior

**Before**: "Claude loads file content automatically"
**After**: "Signals Claude to read files on-demand via tools"

### Added - Session Search Tool (`cs`)

**Problem solved**: After weeks of Claude Code usage, finding past conversations becomes painful:
- `claude --resume` is interactive (no search)
- Sessions accumulate in `~/.claude/projects/`
- No quick way to search "that session where I talked about auth"

**Solution**: `cs` — Zero-dependency bash script for searching and resuming sessions.

```bash
cs                    # List 10 recent sessions (15ms)
cs "authentication"   # Full-text search (400ms)
cs -n 20              # More results

# Output:
# 2026-01-15 08:32 │ my-project │ Implement OAuth flow for...
#   claude --resume 84287c0d-8778-4a8d-abf1-eb2807e327a8
```

**Performance comparison**:

| Tool | List | Search | Deps | Resume cmd |
|------|------|--------|------|------------|
| `cs` (this script) | 15ms | 400ms | None | ✅ Shown |
| claude-conversation-extractor | 230ms | 1.7s | Python | ❌ |
| `claude --resume` native | 500ms+ | ❌ | None | Interactive |

**Files created/modified**:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `examples/scripts/session-search.sh` | Script in repo (source) |
| `examples/README.md` | Entry in Scripts table |
| `guide/ops/observability.md` | Section "Session Search & Resume" |
| `guide/ultimate-guide.md:505-524` | Examples in "Finding session IDs" |
| `README.md:398-403` | Section "Utility Scripts" |
| `machine-readable/reference.yaml` | `deep_dive.session_search` entry |

**Installation** (local):
```bash
# Copy script
cp examples/scripts/session-search.sh ~/.claude/scripts/cs
chmod +x ~/.claude/scripts/cs

# Add alias to shell
echo 'alias cs="~/.claude/scripts/cs"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Added - Security Documentation

| File | Addition |
|------|----------|
| guide/security/security-hardening.md | Section 1.2 "Known Limitations of permissions.deny" |

**Content**:
- Blocking matrix (Read/Edit/Write/Bash)
- Security gaps documented (GitHub #4160)
- Recommended exhaustive config
- Defense-in-depth strategy

### Root Cause Analysis

The factual errors originated from:
1. **SuperClaude framework confusion**: User had `~/.claude/FLAGS.md` with custom flags that were documented as if official
2. **Assumption propagation**: "selective loading" concept was assumed from other AI tools
3. **Outdated syntax**: `excludePatterns` may have been planned but never implemented

## [2.9.0] - 2026-01-12

### Fixed
- **MCP detection bug in audit-scan.sh** (~60 lines modified)
  - **Root cause**: Script searched for `~/.claude/mcp.json` which doesn't exist
  - **Actual location**: Claude Code stores MCP config in `~/.claude.json` under `projects.<path>.mcpServers`
  - **Solution**: Multi-source detection with priority:
    1. `~/.claude.json` → `projects.<cwd>.mcpServers` (most common)
    2. `./.claude/mcp.json` (project-level)
    3. `~/.claude/mcp.json` (legacy global)
  - JSON output now includes detailed `mcp` section (configured, count, servers, source)
  - Human output shows server count and source location
- **Bug `0\n0` in `claude_md_refs`** (~8 lines)

  - **Solution**: Rewritten `count_pattern()` function to properly capture and return count

### Changed
- **audit-scan.sh** enhanced (~50 lines)
  - Added `MCP_SOURCE` variable to track where MCP config was found
  - Added `MCP_COUNT` variable for server count

  - Phase 1.2: Complete MCP detection rewrite covering all 3 locations
  - Glossary: Updated MCP definition to explain config locations
  - Version: 2.8 → 2.9

### Stats
