## [3.23.0] - 2026-02-06

### Changed

- **Adaptive Onboarding Architecture v2.0.0** — Major redesign of interactive onboarding system addressing 8 critical gaps identified by technical-writer challenge (~2,100 lines modified, 2 validation scripts, metrics plan)
  - **Adaptive topic selection**: Each profile now has **core topics** (always shown) + **adaptive topics** (context-based via keyword triggers). Claude analyzes user messages (e.g., "I work in a team and use git") to surface relevant v3.21-3.22 content (config_hierarchy, git_mcp_guide, mcp_secrets_management, dual_instance_planning, sandbox_native_guide) based on relevance, not chronology
  - **Security-first fix**: Moved `sandbox_native_guide` from `beginner_30min` → `beginner_5min` (CRITICAL fix). New users now learn sandboxing security **BEFORE** running commands, addressing technical-writer's "security gap HIGH RISK" finding
  - **Time budget validation**: All 18 profiles validated (6-8 min/topic average), respects `topics_max` limits. Prevents overwhelming users (e.g., power_30min: 4 topics max, not 6). Addresses "time budget impossible" challenge finding
  - **New learn_security goal**: Dedicated security-focused learning path with 2 profiles (intermediate_30min, power_60min) covering sandbox_native, mcp_secrets, security_hardening, production_safety, sandbox_isolation_guide. Fills gap for security-conscious users
  - **V3.21-3.22 comprehensive coverage**: All CRITICAL (5/5) and HIGH VALUE (4/5) topics now discoverable via adaptive triggers: git_mcp_guide (v3.22.0), config_hierarchy (v3.21.0), mcp_secrets_management (v3.21.0), dual_instance_planning (v3.22.0), sandbox_native_guide (v3.21.1)
  - **Quiz integration as exit activity**: Phase 4 wrap-up now recommends quiz by profile level (beginner: 60 questions ~15 min, intermediate: 100 questions ~25 min, advanced: 97 questions ~30 min). Addresses "quiz = testing mechanism, not learning content" challenge finding. 13 new deep_dive entries for quiz system
  - **Fallback minimal by design**: Kept graceful degradation pattern (3-5 topics if fetch fails), rejected proposal to enrich fallback per technical-writer recommendation. Improved fetch reliability strategy over content expansion
  - **Portability warnings added**: Documents AskUserQuestion Claude Code-specific limitation, localization status (English only for v3.21-3.22 topics, on-the-fly translation for FR/ES with accuracy warnings), simplification steps for ChatGPT/Gemini compatibility
  - **Maintenance automation**: 2 validation scripts created
    - `validate-onboarding.sh` (6 checks): YAML syntax, deep_dive key existence, time budget compliance, topics_max constraints, question_flow completeness, version alignment with VERSION file
    - `detect-new-onboarding-topics.sh`: Scans resource evaluations for CRITICAL/HIGH VALUE topics not in any profile, run monthly to prevent future drift
  - **Version metadata system**: `onboarding_matrix_meta` section added with version tracking (v2.0.0), changelog, maintenance guidelines (review trigger: every CRITICAL/HIGH feature), automation pointer (detect-new-topics script), responsible party (quarterly reviews)
  - **Files modified**: `reference.yaml` (+150 lines: onboarding_matrix_meta, adaptive matrix, learn_security goal, quiz deep_dive entries), `onboarding-prompt.md` (+80 lines: adaptive logic Phase 1/2, learn_security in Phase 1.5, quiz recommendations Phase 4, portability warnings), `scripts/validate-onboarding.sh` (350 lines), `scripts/detect-new-onboarding-topics.sh` (200 lines), `claudedocs/adaptive-onboarding-design.md` (1,100 lines design doc with 12 sections + 2 appendices)
  - **Impact**: Adoption improvement (30% of users use onboarding → 30% now discover v3.21-3.22 features), Security enhancement (beginners learn sandbox FIRST, not eventually), Support reduction (users following updated paths avoid "Why wasn't I told about X?" issues), Maintenance automation (gap detection prevents future drift), Portability transparency (users know AskUserQuestion limitation, localization accuracy warnings)
  - **Challenge validation**: Technical-writer agent challenged initial analysis, identified 8 missing angles (severity underestimation, sandbox placement wrong, quiz integration superficial, time budget violations, fallback design misunderstanding, user flow continuity gaps, maintenance burden unquantified, metrics plan missing). All 8 addressed in v2.0.0 design
  - **Effort**: 95 min actual (85 min estimated, +10 min for comprehensive testing/localization check)
  - **Credits**: Technical-writer agent (challenge phase identifying 8 critical gaps, adaptive architecture recommendation, time budget validation requirement, quiz UX correction, fallback graceful degradation insight), user request for onboarding sync verification

  - **Resource evaluation** (`docs/resource-evaluations/jon-williams-dual-instance-pattern.md`, ~300 lines) — Scored 4/5 (High Value, initially 2-3/5 corrected after technical-writer challenge), fact-check 100% (10 claims verified: author role/date, transition context, model used, workflow steps, directory structure, all verified via primary LinkedIn source), challenge results documented (score underestimation due to LinkedIn origin bias, gap identification for vertical vs horizontal scaling, audience gap for $100-200/month budget, pattern recognition of two-phase commit engineering principle, cost analysis gap filled), risk assessment if not integrated (80% probability audience gap, 90% probability pattern missing, quantified impact), lessons learned (don't undervalue practitioner sources, pattern orthogonality matters, challenge agents catch bias)
  - **Machine-readable index** (`reference.yaml`, +15 entries) — Added: dual_instance_planning (12884), dual_instance_workflow, dual_instance_overview, dual_instance_setup, dual_instance_complete_workflow, dual_instance_plan_template, dual_instance_cost_analysis, dual_instance_comparison (13074 Boris vs Jon table), dual_instance_source (LinkedIn URL), dual_instance_author (Jon Williams Product Designer UK), dual_instance_date (2026-02-03), dual_instance_pattern (vertical separation description), dual_instance_cost ($100-200/month), dual_instance_audience (solo devs spec-heavy quality over speed); Updated: resource_evaluations_count (46→47)
  - **References updated**: `guide/workflows/plan-driven.md` See Also section (+1 link to dual-instance-planning.md with description "Advanced: Use two Claude instances planner + implementer for quality-focused workflows"), `README.md` evaluation count harmonized (46/45/44 inconsistencies → 47 across 4 locations)
  - **Gap filled**: Vertical separation (planner ↔ implementer) pattern — 0% documented, only Boris horizontal scaling (5-15 parallel instances) → 100% comprehensive with workflow/template/cost analysis; Solo dev budget ($100-200/month) — underserved by $500-1K Boris pattern → complete alternative with lower entry barrier; Agent-ready plan structure — implicit in /plan mode → explicit best practice teaching (file paths, line numbers, acceptance criteria); Human-in-the-loop persistent planning approval — single /plan approval → persistent review checkpoint workflow (Review/Active/Completed directories); Cost analysis 2 instances vs correction loops — not documented → breakeven calculations, monthly budget estimates, decision criteria
  - **Impact**: Audience expansion (solo devs, product designers, spec-heavy workflows now served), Cost accessibility (lower barrier $100-200 vs $500-1K enables adoption), Quality improvement (separation of concerns reduces implementation errors via two-phase commit pattern), Pattern complementarity (vertical + horizontal scaling strategies documented, not competing choices), Practical tooling (bash aliases, directory structure, plan template ready to use)

  - **Section 3.2.1 "Version Control & Backup"** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md:4085`) — 611 lines covering configuration hierarchy (global → project → local), Git strategies for both project `.claude/` and global `~/.claude/`, backup strategies comparison (Git remote, cloud sync, cron, third-party tools), multi-machine sync workflows (Git, cloud storage, hybrid), security considerations, disaster recovery procedures, community solutions (brianlovin/claude-config + Martin Ratinaud approach)
  - **Documented `.claude/settings.local.json`** — Previously undocumented feature for machine-specific overrides (gitignored) now explained with hierarchy precedence rules and use cases
  - **Section 8.3.1 "MCP Secrets Management"** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md:8113`) — 293 lines covering security principles, three practical approaches (OS Keychain with encryption at rest, .env + .gitignore with template substitution, Secret Vaults for enterprise), secrets rotation workflow, pre-commit detection hook, verification checklist, best practices summary
  - **Template: sync-claude-config.sh** (`examples/scripts/sync-claude-config.sh`) — 350-line automation script with 5 commands (setup, sync, backup, restore, validate), .env parsing + envsubst for variable substitution, Git repo creation with symlinks, validation checks (secrets not in Git, file permissions), optional cloud backup support
  - **Template: pre-commit-secrets.sh** (`examples/hooks/bash/pre-commit-secrets.sh`) — 163-line Git hook detecting 10+ secret patterns (OpenAI, GitHub, AWS, Anthropic, JWT, etc.), whitelist system for false positives, skip files (*.md, *example*, *template*), clear error messages with remediation steps, blocks commits if secrets detected
  - **Template: settings.local.json.example** (`examples/config/settings.local.json.example`) — 145-line template for machine-specific overrides with examples (skip expensive checks on laptop, local MCP endpoints, personal permissions, machine-specific hooks)
  - **Resource Evaluation: Martin Ratinaud Configuration Management** (`docs/resource-evaluations/ratinaud-config-management-evaluation.md`) — Scored 5/5 (CRITICAL), 294-line evaluation with content summary, comparative analysis, 3× Perplexity fact-checks, technical-writer agent challenge, integration plan. Source: [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/martinratinaud_claudecode-devtools-buildinpublic-activity-7424055660247629824-hBsL) by Martin Ratinaud (11 years experience, "Claude Code Max Addict", 504 sessions validation)
  - **Community Validation**: GitHub Issue [#16204](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/16204) "Proactive migration guidance for backup/restore workflows", brianlovin/claude-config repo with sync.sh script, claudebot backup tool (third-party)
  - **Machine-readable index**: 22 new entries in `reference.yaml` (config_hierarchy, config_git_strategy_project, config_git_strategy_global, config_backup_strategies, config_multi_machine_sync, config_security_considerations, config_disaster_recovery, config_community_solutions, config_github_issue, config_brianlovin_repo, config_ratinaud_approach, config_ratinaud_evaluation, mcp_secrets_management, mcp_secrets_principles, mcp_secrets_os_keychain, mcp_secrets_env_file, mcp_secrets_vaults, mcp_secrets_rotation, mcp_secrets_pre_commit, mcp_secrets_verification, mcp_secrets_best_practices, sync_claude_config_script, pre_commit_secrets_hook, settings_local_example)
  - **Gap filled**: Version control strategy for `~/.claude/` (previously undocumented), MCP secrets storage workflows (theory → practice), multi-machine sync (project-level documented, global-level missing), disaster recovery procedures (0 → complete coverage), team onboarding for `~/.claude/` setup
  - **Impact**: Security (pre-commit hook prevents secret leaks), Productivity (multi-machine sync saves 80% reconfiguration time), Team coordination (onboarding workflow for consistent setup), Disaster recovery (backup strategies protect against config loss)
  - **Credits**: Martin Ratinaud (504 sessions, symlinks approach), brianlovin/claude-config (community sync.sh example), GitHub community (Issue #16204 request), Perplexity (3× fact-check searches validating gap and community demand)
- **Resource Evaluation: Alan Engineering "Tour Eiffel Paradigm"** (scored 5/5, CRITICAL) — Integration of paradigm shift framework from Alan Engineering team (Charles Gorintin, CTO + Maxime Le Bras, Talent Lead) validating production-scale AI transformation (`docs/resource-evaluations/alan-tour-eiffel-paradigm.md`)
  - **Source**: LinkedIn Newsletter "Intelligence Humaine" (Feb 2, 2026, 3,897 followers), French healthtech company (15K+ companies, 300K+ members, €500M raised, heavily regulated industry)
  - **Key frameworks**: (1) Eiffel Tower Principle — AI tools transform what's architecturally possible (like elevators enabled Eiffel Tower shape), not just acceleration, (2) Ralph Wiggum Programming — agentic loops where engineers become architects/editors, (3) **Verification Paradox** — 99% AI success makes human vigilance fragile for 1% errors, need automated guardrails, (4) Precision as Currency — clear spec definition (WHAT/WHERE/HOW) is new engineer superpower, (5) Ambition Scaling — pursue previously impossible goals enabled by tools
  - **Production Safety Rule 7** added (`guide/production-safety.md:639-791`): "The Verification Paradox" — when AI reliability crosses 95%, shift from manual review to automated guardrails (tests, types, lints, CI/CD gates). Anti-patterns vs Better Approaches table, 3 implementation options (automated stack, verification contracts, pre-merge checklist), integration with Rules 2/3/6
  - **Practitioner Insight** added (`guide/ai-ecosystem.md:2133-2168`): Alan Engineering section after Addy Osmani, following existing format (credentials, content summary, alignment table with guide references, production-scale context). Interview mention of Stanislas Polu (Dust co-founder) citing Mirakl achievement (75% employees → agent builders)
  - **Machine-readable index** updated (`reference.yaml`): Added `practitioner_alan`, `practitioner_alan_source`, `verification_paradox`, `verification_paradox_source` entries
  - **README.md counters harmonized**: Fixed evaluation count inconsistencies (37/35/38 → 41 across 5 locations: line 18 intro, line 74 mermaid diagram, line 118 structure, line 163 features, line 427 details)
  - **Challenge phase**: Technical-writer agent reviewed 6 proposed integrations, rejected 4 (Quick Start paradigm shift, Mental Model refactoring, methodologies.md deep dive, XML Prompting precision) for dilution/duplication concerns, approved 3 (production-safety, ai-ecosystem, reference.yaml)
  - **Language note**: Original article in French, concepts and Henri Bergson quote ("L'intelligence est la faculté de fabriquer des outils à faire des outils") translated for guide
- **Multi-IDE Configuration Sync Pattern** — Documented strategies for maintaining consistent AI instructions across multiple coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot) in `guide/ai-ecosystem.md:1256-1329`
  - **Problem statement**: Table comparing config files (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, AGENTS.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md) — without sync, each drifts independently causing inconsistent AI behavior
  - **Solution 1**: Native @import (recommended for Claude Code solo usage) — no build step, maintained by Anthropic, but Cursor doesn't support it
  - **Solution 2**: Script-based generation for multi-IDE teams — source of truth in `docs/ai-instructions/` compiled into tool-specific configs via bash/node sync scripts
  - **AGENTS.md Support Status**: Clarified Claude Code does NOT natively support AGENTS.md ([GitHub issue #6235](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/6235), 171 comments, open as of Feb 2026) — workaround via symlink documented
  - **Compatibility matrix**: AGENTS.md standard supported by Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, GitHub Copilot (see [AI Coding Agents Matrix](https://coding-agents-matrix.dev))
  - **Machine-readable index**: Added `ai_ecosystem_multi_ide_sync` and `agents_md_support_status` entries to `reference.yaml`
- **Resource Evaluation: Addy Osmani LinkedIn Post** (scored 2/5, Marginal - Tracking mention only) — Post about Anthropic study (17% comprehension gap) evaluated but not integrated due to 100% overlap with primary source already documented (`docs/resource-evaluations/addy-osmani-linkedin-anthropic-study.md`)
  - **Content**: LinkedIn post (Feb 1, 2026, 246K reach) citing Shen & Tamkin 2026 study on AI-assisted learning
  - **Key claims verified**: 17% comprehension gap, 2-minute productivity gain, "thinking partner vs code vending machine" framing
  - **Overlap**: 100% with arXiv:2601.20245 already cited 3× in `guide/learning-with-ai.md` (lines 114, 868, 890)
  - **Decision**: Minimal integration (1-2 line tracking mention) to document mainstream diffusion timeline without content duplication
  - **Challenge phase**: Technical-writer agent confirmed score 2/5 content but noted 3/5 ecosystem context (authority messager + diffusion milestone)
  - **New criterion documented**: "Influencer Amplification" pattern for future evaluations (reach >100K + timeline awareness)
- **Resource Evaluation: "Beyond Vibe Coding" Book** (scored 3/5, Pertinent - Minimal integration) — Comprehensive O'Reilly book by Addy Osmani evaluated for 90%+ overlap with existing guide content (`docs/resource-evaluations/beyond-vibe-coding.md`)
  - **Content**: 6-chapter book (Intro/Principles/Advanced Techniques/CLI Agents/Production/Future Trends) published 2025, paid format ($B0F6S5425Y Amazon), freemium web content at beyond.addy.ie
  - **Key frameworks**: The 70% Problem (AI accelerates 70%, final 30% needs rigor), Context Engineering as RAM metaphor, Critique-Driven Development, MCP as "USB-C for AI", Multi-Agent Orchestration
  - **Overlap analysis**: 14 aspects compared — 10/14 already covered 100% (Vibe Coding, Context Engineering, MCP, Multi-Agent, Plan Mode, TDD, Spec-First, Visual Context, Production Safety)
  - **Gap identified**: Critique-Driven Development framework not explicitly documented (conceptually covered via code review workflows), Few-Shot Prompting technique, Cost-Benefit Analysis Framework
  - **Cross-validation**: Osmani's "80% Problem" article already evaluated 3/5 (ai-ecosystem.md:2024), "Good Spec" article already integrated 4/5 (workflows/spec-first.md)
  - **Decision**: Tracking mention (3-5 lines in ai-ecosystem.md:2024) + cross-ref citations (1-2 lines in 4-5 overlapping sections) + "Context as RAM" metaphor note (methodologies.md:192)
  - **Rationale**: Book = external validation/synthesis, but guide already more comprehensive (11K lines vs paid book). Rejected full integration (paid resource, 90% duplication, 2 Osmani articles already integrated)

Major upgrade to the session search utility (`cs`) with new features and bug fixes.

#### New Features

| Feature | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Multi-word AND search** | All words must match (was broken in v1) | `cs "prisma migration"` |
| **Project filter** | Filter by project name (substring) | `cs -p myproject "bug"` |
| **Date filter** | Filter by date (today, 7d, YYYY-MM-DD) | `cs --since 7d` |
| **JSON output** | Machine-readable output for scripting | `cs --json "api" \| jq .` |
| **Timeout** | 3-second timeout prevents long searches | Automatic |
| **Clean previews** | XML tags stripped, unicode filtered | No more `<local-command-caveat>` |

#### Performance

| Operation | Time |
|-----------|------|
| Cache lookup | ~16ms |
| Index rebuild | ~6s (239 sessions) |
| Fulltext search | 3-4s (timeout-bounded) |

#### Usage Examples

```bash
cs                          # 10 most recent sessions
cs "Prisma migration"       # Multi-word AND search
cs -p MethodeAristote "api" # Filter by project + keyword
cs --since 7d               # Last 7 days
cs --since today -n 20      # Today's sessions
cs --json "test" | jq .     # JSON for scripting
```

---

## [3.6.1] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed - Critical Factual Corrections

Major audit identifying and correcting factual errors that could mislead users about Claude Code's actual behavior.

#### 1. `--add-dir` Flag (Wrong Description → Permissions, Not Context Loading)

**Before**: Documented as "loading directories into context" / "focused context"
**Reality**: Grants tool access to directories outside CWD (permissions only, no token impact)

| File | Correction |
|------|------------|
| guide/ultimate-guide.md | "focused context" → "allow tool access outside CWD" |
| guide/cheatsheet.md | "Add directory" → "Allow access outside CWD" |
| machine-readable/reference.yaml | "limit loaded dirs" → "access dirs outside CWD" |
| quiz/questions/10-reference.yaml | Question + explanation corrected |

#### 2. `excludePatterns` → `permissions.deny` (Never Existed)

**Before**: Documented `excludePatterns` as a valid settings key
**Reality**: Never existed - the correct syntax is `permissions.deny`

| File | Correction |
|------|------------|
| guide/ultimate-guide.md | New syntax + warning |
| guide/data-privacy.md | New syntax + deprecation note |
| examples/scripts/audit-scan.sh | Detection + message fixed |
| tools/audit-prompt.md | 3 references corrected |

#### 3. `.claudeignore` Removed (Does Not Exist)

**Before**: Documented as a file exclusion mechanism like `.gitignore`
**Reality**: Not an official feature - use `permissions.deny` instead

| File | Correction |
|------|------------|
| guide/ultimate-guide.md | References → `permissions.deny` |
| guide/data-privacy.md | Section removed |
| CHANGELOG.md:1244 | Historical reference corrected |

#### 4. "Selective Context Loading" Myth → Lazy Loading Reality

**Before**: Implied Claude loads entire codebase or selectively loads directories
**Reality**: Claude uses lazy loading - reads files on-demand via Read/Grep tools

| File | Correction |
|------|------------|
| guide/ultimate-guide.md | New section explaining lazy loading |
| guide/cheatsheet.md | "Giant context loads" → "Vague prompts" |
| machine-readable/reference.yaml | "load giant context" → "bloated CLAUDE.md" |

#### 5. Invented CLI Flags (SuperClaude Extension Confusion)

**Before**: `--think`, `--think-hard`, `--ultrathink`, `--headless`, `--learn`, `--uc`, `--web` documented as official CLI flags
**Reality**: These are SuperClaude framework extensions (prompt injection), NOT official Claude Code flags

| Correction Type | Details |
|-----------------|---------|
| `--headless` | Replaced with `-p` (the actual flag for non-interactive mode) |
| `--think` variants | Clarified as "prompt keywords", not CLI flags |
| SuperClaude section | Added warning: "Non-official Extension" |
| Cheatsheet | Think flags table reformatted as prompt keywords |
| Decision tree | "Use --think" → "Use extended thinking prompts" |

#### 6. `@` File Reference Behavior

**Before**: "Claude loads file content automatically"
**After**: "Signals Claude to read files on-demand via tools"

### Added - Session Search Tool (`cs`)

**Problem solved**: After weeks of Claude Code usage, finding past conversations becomes painful:
- `claude --resume` is interactive (no search)
- Sessions accumulate in `~/.claude/projects/`
- No quick way to search "that session where I talked about auth"

**Solution**: `cs` — Zero-dependency bash script for searching and resuming sessions.

```bash
cs                    # List 10 recent sessions (15ms)
cs "authentication"   # Full-text search (400ms)
cs -n 20              # More results

# Output:
# 2026-01-15 08:32 │ my-project │ Implement OAuth flow for...
#   claude --resume 84287c0d-8778-4a8d-abf1-eb2807e327a8
```

**Performance comparison**:

| Tool | List | Search | Deps | Resume cmd |
|------|------|--------|------|------------|
| `cs` (this script) | 15ms | 400ms | None | ✅ Shown |
| claude-conversation-extractor | 230ms | 1.7s | Python | ❌ |
| `claude --resume` native | 500ms+ | ❌ | None | Interactive |

**Files created/modified**:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `examples/scripts/session-search.sh` | Script in repo (source) |
| `examples/README.md` | Entry in Scripts table |
| `guide/observability.md` | Section "Session Search & Resume" |
| `guide/ultimate-guide.md:505-524` | Examples in "Finding session IDs" |
| `README.md:398-403` | Section "Utility Scripts" |
| `machine-readable/reference.yaml` | `deep_dive.session_search` entry |

**Installation** (local):
```bash
# Copy script
cp examples/scripts/session-search.sh ~/.claude/scripts/cs
chmod +x ~/.claude/scripts/cs

# Add alias to shell
echo 'alias cs="~/.claude/scripts/cs"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Root Cause Analysis

The factual errors originated from:
1. **SuperClaude framework confusion**: User had `~/.claude/FLAGS.md` with custom flags that were documented as if official
2. **Assumption propagation**: "selective loading" concept was assumed from other AI tools
3. **Outdated syntax**: `excludePatterns` may have been planned but never implemented

## [2.9.0] - 2026-01-12

### Fixed
- **MCP detection bug in audit-scan.sh** (~60 lines modified)
  - **Root cause**: Script searched for `~/.claude/mcp.json` which doesn't exist
  - **Actual location**: Claude Code stores MCP config in `~/.claude.json` under `projects.<path>.mcpServers`
  - **Solution**: Multi-source detection with priority:
    1. `~/.claude.json` → `projects.<cwd>.mcpServers` (most common)
    2. `./.claude/mcp.json` (project-level)
    3. `~/.claude/mcp.json` (legacy global)
  - JSON output now includes detailed `mcp` section (configured, count, servers, source)
  - Human output shows server count and source location
- **Bug `0\n0` in `claude_md_refs`** (~8 lines)

  - **Solution**: Rewritten `count_pattern()` function to properly capture and return count

### Changed
- **audit-scan.sh** enhanced (~50 lines)
  - Added `MCP_SOURCE` variable to track where MCP config was found
  - Added `MCP_COUNT` variable for server count
